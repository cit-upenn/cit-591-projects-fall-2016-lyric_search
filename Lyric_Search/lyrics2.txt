Murs|Murs 3:16: The 9th Edition|Walk Like A Man|[Verse 1] Now I used to walk with the gun now I walk like a man And I walk what I talk and I walk, never ran And I never say never but I mean hardly ever And if shootin's the solution then you're not that clever If you don't know shit then you still know better Human life is so precious it could never be measured Have you ever had it loaded and cocked back the heat? Plottin' on the next nigga while he walkin' up the street Trigger off safety spacin an opportunity These niggas wanna waste me it ain't nothing new to me Soon as he walked by I was ready to bust But he just posted up like he was waitin' on the bus Now I'm all pumped up with a steroid trigger Cause most of y'all are easy just some paranoid niggas Used to walk with a gun but I never did use it What's the point of holdin' heat if you ain't gonna shoot it? Stupid [Verse 2] It was a late night sunset me and him out Lookin' at the ladies to come up on some trim Everybody wildin' out cause the summer's bout to end He had the Hypnotiq he was mixin' with the Henn Off that mean green laid back with the deep lean on low pro shit That's how we rolled on the scene Two girls lookin' probably in they late teens But these days you can't tell but I figured what the hell So we yell out: "Hey girl," they yell back Maybe two in the front maybe two in the back But they had this dark tint, couldn't see through the black We roll up on 'em ask 'em "where the party at?" They just start to laugh and I knew it was a trap But I couldn't roll out cause the strip was so packed Now I'm lookin' at this nigga in his *red* and *white* hat Start talkin' that *blood* shit like we was on some *cuz* shit My nigga used to bang but we ain't on no thug shit I tried to dismantle it but you know Los Angeles This nigga kept talkin' so my boy had to handle it He jumped out the lac snatched the dude out his hat I put it in park jumped out to get his back But as I did that, I heard two shots I turned to my right and I see my dude drop Time stopped. Couldn't believe what I seen Was struck by reality when the two girls screamed I saw his killer stand up he put the gun in his jeans Saw him wince from the pain as the heat burned his waist Then he turned up the block; disappeared without a trace I remember his face but what I remember most Was when I got to my knees and I held my nigga close And asked not to leave us in the name of Christ Jesus But he's gone and all I got left is his blood on my sneakers [Bridge] It was a year to this day that my best friend died For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried And I tried to pretend everything was fine But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine [Verse 3] The day began with me standin' at his grave with his mother His old girlfriend, his two younger brothers We said a few words faces covered with tears On how we missed him so much and we wished he was here Then his girl said a poem put some roses on his stone And we said our goodbyes and they all went home I thought I'd use this time for me and him to be alone I broke out the Hen' poured a little out for him Told him who was gettin' married, who had went to the pen How the homie named his newborn son after him But as the sun went down our talk came to an end So I said a quick prayer..amen And I shook in the lac cross the railroad tracks And I headed up La Brea, saw the homie Isaiah I asked him what he doin' he was way out of bounds He said he had a freak that lived on that side of town But he always kept the heat just in case it went down I clown, then I rolled down my window 'bout to light a ciga- Hey! Is that that nigga... gimme your motherfucking gun right now Man, drive around the block and post up for a minute I hit you on the chirp, hit the corner nigga bend it Splendid now with vengeance in my grasp I couldn't dream of a better day for me to catch his ass Slippin' while he dip into the ride by himself I slid up behind him in the shadows hella stealth He started to break hisself I said I didn't want a dime Do you remember what you was doin' last year about this time? He looked into my eyes with both shock and surprise I split his face with the Glock right before he could reply He cried as I pressed the heat against his cheek Then I squoze two times for the homie rest in peace [Outro] It was a year to this day that my best friend died For weeks I sat alone in my room and cried And I tried to pretend everything was fine But my soul couldn't rest until vengeance was mine It was a year to this day that my best friend died And for weeks I sat alone in my room and cried And I thought that's what I wanted til the problem was confronted Now I'm haunted by remorse that I wished I hadn't done it

B.o.B|B.o.B Vs. Bobby Ray|Change Gonna Come|[Hook] It's been a long A long time coming but I know Change gonna come [Verse 1: Charles Hamilton] Prisoner to my cerebellum So I reach out to the listeners And my mission is I better tell 'em Our fear of a free mind is hearing Your spirit can die anytime You need to cry and so you hide it deep inside Reason why? How can you change what was written? Easy, don't focus your brain on what they mentioned I got so used to tryna make due I feel like I'm cheating when I'm faced with a break through The man in the mirror keeps saying I hate you I respond like lil nigga I made you Slay those sayin they could break you So when I take a break I go ape come back and play fool When they think they won that's when I crush them Change is eminent I evolve so it's nothing What's the discussion Charles Hamilton [Hook] [Verse 2: Asher Roth] We've been pompous ever since Columbus couldn't work a compass We've accomplished what we've conjured up while conscious Unconsciously we've conquered all the eye can see Constantly concocting more options but jobs are still obsolete It seems so odd to me, an odyssey How honesty is honestly the rarest thing upon us It's astonishing How did all the honest people vanish from the planet? Leaving us a laundry list of problems to acknowledge While plotting with my phonics me and Conic and B.o.B Nag Champa rises as I sit down and sketch my rhymes Stretch my mind to figure out what's next in line The next Em, Ye and Andre? Nah homie its just been a long A long time coming [Hook] [Verse 3: B.o.B] Well as you listening to this track You probably about to blog about it and maybe say its wack Or maybe compare the verses to see which one of us has snapped Completely ignoring the fact that this is way more than rap Cause I happen to be on a magazine you happen to see this issue Some people wish you well man some people turn against you Some people even call up to the station just to diss you You bitch you, you only mad at your self here's a tissue But that ain't even my focus man that hate ain't on my menu Im in a different city about to rock a different venue My girl sent me a text message just to say "i miss you" It won't be long before I'm home baby but the rent's due Ha ha ha [Hook]

In the paper, the news, every day I am I don't know, it's just the way I am [Verse 2] Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense It's constant, and, "Oh, it's his lyrical content The song 'Guilty Conscience' Has gotten such rotten responses" And all of this controversy circles me And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up With the bullshit they pull, ‘cause they full of shit too When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin Where were the parents at? And look where it's at! Middle America, now it's a tragedy Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city Havin' this happening Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need For the fire to burn, and it's burning, and I have returned [Hook] And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam ‘Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

Eminem|The Eminem Show|Hailie's Song|[Intro] Yo, I can't sing, but I feel like singing I wanna fuckin' sing ‘Cause I'm happy Yeah, I'm happy I got my baby back Yo, check it out [Verse 1] Some days, I sit, staring out the window Watching this world pass me by Sometimes, I think there's nothing to live for I almost break down and cry Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time? But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no [Hook 1] ‘Cause sometimes, it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me ‘Cause sometimes, it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me [Verse 2] My baby girl keeps getting older I watch her grow up with pride People make jokes, ‘cause they don't understand me They just don't see my real side I act like shit don't faze me, inside, it drives me crazy My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no [Hook 1] ‘Cause sometimes, it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me ‘Cause sometimes, it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me [Verse 3] Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't want her Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona That I'm a pistol-packing drug addict who bags on his mama But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest ‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled That hurts deep inside of my soul And just know that I grow colder the older I grow This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold And this load is like the weight of the world And I think my neck is breakin' Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? Now, look, I love my daughter more than life in itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life living hell But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt So many chances, man, it's too bad, could've had someone else But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facing: three felonies, six years of probation I've went to jail for this woman I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to people's backs Bent over backwards for this woman Man, I should've seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up If I'd have seen what she was fuckin', but fuck it It's over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner And suddenly, it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and now [Hook 2] And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me ‘Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier Nothing can take her from me [Outro] Wooo! Told you I can't sing, oh well, I tried Hailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there? Guess what, Daddy's here And I ain't going nowhere, baby, I love you (??*smooch*)??

Eminem|The Slim Shady LP|Brain Damage|[Intro] (Doctor) Scalpel (Nurse) Here (Doctor) Sponge (Nurse) Here (Doctor) Wait… he's convulsing, he's convulsing (Nurse) Ah! (Doctor) We're gonna have to shock him (Nurse) Oh my! Oh my God! (Doctor) We're gonna have to shock him (Nurse) Oh my God! [Verse 1] These are the results of a thousand electric volts A neck with bolts (Nurse, we're losing him, check the pulse!) A kid who refused to respect adults Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose A corny looking white boy, scrawny and always ornery ‘Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies picking on me And I might snap, one day just like that I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack My first day in junior high, this kid said "It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die" I looked at my watch, it was 1:20 "I already gave you my lunch money What more do you want from me?!" He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse" My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works" I screamed, "Oww! My appendix feels like they could burst Teacher, teacher! Quick, I need a naked nurse" "What's the matter?" I don't know, my leg, it hurts "Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy" Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee "Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over. And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework" But don't you wanna give me after school detention? "Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mma let him" [Hook] Brain damage, ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was going But everywhere I go they keep playing my song Brain damage, ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was going But everywhere I go they keep playing my song [Verse 2] Way before my baby daughter Hailie I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, ‘cause his father boxes, so every day he'd shove me in the lockers One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin' And had me in the position to beat me into submission He banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose Soaked my clothes in blood Grabbed me and choked my throat I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef But he just wouldn't leave He kept choking me and I couldn't breathe He looked at me and said, "You gonna die, honky!" The principal walked in and started helping him stomp me I made them think they beat me to death Holding my breath for like five minutes before they finally left Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth Kicked the door hinge loose And ripped out the four inch screws Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools This is for every time you took my orange juice Or stole my seat in the lunchroom And drank my chocolate milk Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt I'm getting you back, bully, now once and for good I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could And beat him over the head with it till I broke the wood Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot Made it home, later that same day Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray I couldn't even see what I was trying to read I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed My mother started screaming, "What are you on, drugs?! Look at you! You're getting blood all over my rug!" (sorry) She beat me over the head with the remote control Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull I picked it up and screamed "Look bitch, what have you done?" "Oh my God, I'm sorry, son" – shut up, you cunt! I said fuck it, took it and stuck it back up in my head Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck [Hook] Brain damage, ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was going But everywhere I go they keep playing my song Brain damage, ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was going But everywhere I go they keep playing my song Brain damage Is brain damage I got brain damage Is brain damage Is probably brain damage Is brain damage Brain damage I got brain damage...

2Pac|Until the End of Time|When Thugz Cry|[Intro] When thugs cry Now I lay me down to sleep I pray the Lord my guns to keep If I die before I wake I pray the Lord my soul to take Got us dyin' When thugs cry, times is hard [Verse 1] Born thuggin', and lovin' the way I came up Big money clutchin', bustin' while evadin' cocaine busts My pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried I got a line on the D.A. ‘cause I'm fuckin' his secretary I black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all They panic, and bitches duckin', I rush 'em and fuck 'em all I'll probably be an old man before I understand Why I have to live my life with pistols close at hand Kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad They even raped her, so we blazed they pad Automatic shots rang out, on every block They puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin' What is the meanin' when thugs cry? [Hook: singer & (2Pac)] Oh, why should you send your child off to die? In the streets of chalk where they lie Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God (when thugs cry) Oh my, does it have to be this way? Our children of today won't stay wise Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why? [Verse 2] Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin' Where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary Niggas I used to love, enclosed in Penitentiaries But still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel To lose your life, over something that you did as a kid? You all alone, no communication, block on the phone Don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song To help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange Lost all my homies over cocaine, mayne See, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie See, you gotta get high or die, ‘cause even thugs cry [Hook: singer] Oh, why should you send your child off to die? In the streets of chalk where they lie Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God Oh my, does it have to be this way? Our children of today won't stay wise Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why? [Verse 3] And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures Bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures ‘Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don I write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone Why perpetrate like you can handle my team? So merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams Leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood Clownin', takin' pictures later Laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches Regulate my area, the terror I represent Makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul? Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told Come take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer! Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close? I suppose that's why I murder my foes; when thugs cry [Hook: singer] Oh, why should you send your child off to die? In the streets of chalk where they lie Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God Oh my, does it have to be this way? Our children of today won't stay wise Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why? Oh, why should you send your child off to die? In the streets of chalk where they lie Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God Oh my, does it have to be this way? Our children of today won't stay wise Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why? [Collision] I shed tattooed tears for years For my dead homeboys and my prison peers Y'all ain't never heard my cries Now you wonder why would you die?

Masta Ace|Hits U Missed|Last Bref|[Verse 1: Masta Ace] I'mma tell you one last time in one last rhyme And listen closely, cause if my name was Josie A lot of you pussy cats would be out of the game Regardless of fame, because I hear a lot of the same It's not impressive, y'all should be more aggressive You're too passive. And the rap game is too massive For niggas to be standing around, trying to be him Rapping about the same old Benz and BM Look - I know the way. You can't win as a protege So throw the crocodile shoes and mink coat away And come back with flows sharp as a thumbtack I bump that. In my pickup with the gun rack Driving down the middle of 95, I be live Hoping that my song get a buzz like a beehive I experience heavy breathing regardless of the season for one reason Hip Hop's full of treason, I'm leaving, yo [Hook: Masta Ace] It don't matter how many you sold Platinum or Gold, hot or cold, yo (Last Bref) Yall can keep on nappin but if you're out there rappin It will happen, yo (Last Bref) It's like death and taxes You can't get by it, so don't try it yo (Last Bref) You won't know it's your last left...your last breath [Verse 2: Masta Ace] I got a sick caper, smoother than Vick's Vapor I can break you fast as a nigga that tricks paper My main focus and purpose is to make sure nobody jerk us Cause the rap game right now is a circus I honestly hate rappers, most of them great actors With songs that couldn't turn me on with eight clappers And the saddest thing is platinum status is king If you got the sickest watch, or the baddest ring You're hotter than three cops in a weed spot with three Glocks And a search warrant - they thirst for it I'm a sad soul, probably rap til I'm mad old And sound worse than D.O.C. with a bad cold I'll sit in my rocker and freestyle for my doctor Stand up and shock ya with hella flows like a copter I'll show a young whipper snapper rapper I'm greater And then have to rest later, on a respirator, yo [Hook] [Verse 3: Masta Ace] In the game of rap, there'll be none of that coming back As soon as a nigga drops the ball like a running back It's over, you could do a song with Jay Hova Get DMX to sing the hook, nigga look It happened to the best and it's gone happen to the rest So I hope you don't think you're immune to the same doom We can be in two different states or the same room It don't matter - I'mma hear your career shatter I personally know a few, tried to show a few That got back in the ring to try to go a few It ain't the same, believe me, it ain't the name It's not the label, you could do a show on cable You could go to the Source Awards And pay the Ku Klux a few bucks to drag you around in a blue truck And rap fans'll walk on by when you're past death and laid out And just finished taking your last breath yo [Hook]

Eminem|Curtain Call: The Hits|When I'm Gone|[Intro] Yeah, it's my life In my own words, I guess [Verse 1] Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for? Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for? When they know they're your heart And you know you were their armor And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her But what happens when karma Turns right around and bites you? And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you? What happens when you become the main source of a pain? "Daddy, look what I made!", Dad's gotta go catch a plane "Daddy, where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy, where is she?" I don't know, go play, Hailie, baby, your daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's a spitting image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah, baby, Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby [Hook] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back [Verse 2] I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing She keeps screaming she don't want me to sing "You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy cryin'?" Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy, you're lyin' You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy, you're mine" She's piling boxes in front of the door, tryin' to block it "Daddy, please, Daddy, don't leave, Daddy – no, stop it!" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe, Daddy, take it withcha" I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talking ‘cause, man, I can hear 'em They're saying "You've got one more chance To do right – and it's tonight! Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late!" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door, it turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on, and I'm singing… [Hook] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back [Verse 3] Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet I take a bow and thank you all for coming out They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein' "Daddy, it's me! Help Mommy, her wrists are bleedin'" But, baby, we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden? "I followed you, Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin' You lied to me, Dad, and now you make Mommy sad And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad' That's all I wanted, I just wanted to give you this coin I get the point – fine, me and Mommy are goin'" But, baby, wait! "It's too late, Dad, you made the choice Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us That's what they want, they want you, Marshall, they keep Screamin' your name, it's no wonder you can't go to sleep Just take another pill, yeah, I bet you you will You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real" I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be that the curtain is closing on me? I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it Put it to my brain, scream "Die, Shady!" and pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes The plane that I was supposed to be on crashes And burns to ashes; that's when I wake up Alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin' It's Spring and Hailie's outside swingin' I walk right up to Kim and kiss her, tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister, almost as if to… [Hook] And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling And I didn't feel a thing, so baby Don't feel no pain, just smile back *Curtains Closing*

Holy Bible (KJV)|Holy Bible|John 2|John 2:1: And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there: John 2:2: And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage. John 2:3: And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. John 2:4: Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. John 2:5: His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it. John 2:6: And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece. John 2:7: Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim. John 2:8: And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. John 2:9: When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom. John 2:10: And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. John 2:11: This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. John 2:12: After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. John 2:13: And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. John 2:14: And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: John 2:15: And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables; John 2:16: And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise. John 2:17: And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. John 2:18: Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? John 2:19: Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. John 2:20: Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? John 2:21: But he spake of the temple of his body. John 2:22: When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. John 2:23: Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. John 2:24: But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, John 2:25: And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.

Fiona Apple|When the Pawn...|Paper Bag|[Verse 1] I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star To pray on, or wish on, or something like that I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy Whose reality I knew, was a hopeless to be had But then the dove of hope began its downward slope And I believed for a moment that my chances Were approaching to be grabbed But as it came down near, so did a weary tear I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag [Chorus] Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love [Verse 2] And I went crazy again today Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope Baby said he couldn't stay Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope I said, "Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified Come on put a little love here in my void," He said "It's all in your head," And I said, "So's everything" but he didn't get it I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy [Chorus] Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving works When it costs too much to love Hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh it kills Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up I got to fold cause these hands are just too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving works me When it costs too much to love Hunger hurts but I want him so bad, oh it kills Cause I know I'm a mess that he don't wanna clean up I got to fold cause these hands are just too shaky to hold Hunger hurts, but starving, it works When it costs too much to love, hmm hmm

Eminem|Encore|Crazy in Love|[Intro: Heart (Sampled)] Tell myself that I was doing alright There's nothing left to do tonight [Hook: Heart (Sampled)] But go crazy on you Crazy on you Let me go crazy, crazy on youuuuuuuuuu-ohhhhhh [Verse 1] Can't you see what you do to me baby? You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick You're truly the only one who can do this to me You just make me get so crazy I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanted sex You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit Cause the next day we're right back at it In the same exact pattern What the fuck is the matter with us? We can't figure out if it's lust Or it's love what's that that's attracting us to each other? They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch But I stay and still stick it out with you Even though I just hit you today But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you Just cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises Always pullin' devices out your purse little vibrators and dildoes You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma-ture Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls Like they're in middle school still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin' You play your position you never step out of line Even though I stay in your business you've always kept out of mine I wonder what's on your mind, sometimes they say love is blind Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved Maybe cause we're crazy in loooove [Hook: Heart (Sampled)] But go crazy on you Crazy on you Let me go crazy, crazy on youuuuuuuuuu-ohhhhhh](104667) [Verse 2] You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire You're my entire supply - gas, the match, and igniter The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs to my table If you were to break I'd fall on my face But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage But you're essential to me you're the air I breathe I believe If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be You are the Kim to my Marshall you're the Slim to my Shady The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie You are the words that I'm lookin' for when I'm tryin' to describe How I feel inside and the right one that just won't come to my mind You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me And no matter how much too much is never enough Maybe because we're crazy in looooove [Hook: Heart (Sampled)] But go crazy on you Crazy on you Let me go crazy, crazy on youuuuuuuuuu-ohhhhhh](104667)

Drake|Thank Me Later|Karaoke|[Produced by Francis and the Lights] [Verse 1: Drake] Things have been so crazy and hectic I shoulda gotten back by now But you know how much I wanted to make it It's probably better anyhow So if you gotta go If there's anything I should know If the spotlight makes you nervous If you're looking for a purpose [Verse 2: Drake] You put the tea in the kettle and light it Put your hand on the metal and feel it But do you even feel it anymore? I remember when you thought I was joking Now I'm off singing karaoke Further than I've ever been So if you gotta go If there's any way I can help [Verse 3: Drake] Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner And tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta Damn, of all the places you could go I just thought you'd choose somewhere That had somebody that you know I'm always up too late, I worry 'bout you there alone In that place you call your home Warm nights and cold Patron I hope that you don't get known for nothing crazy Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady I know they say the first love is the sweetest But that first cut is the deepest I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets Secrets you were telling everybody but me Don't be fooled by the money, I'm still just young and unlucky I'm surprised you couldn't tell [Outro] I was only trying to get ahead I was only trying to get ahead But the spotlight makes you nervous And you're looking for a purpose

Wale|More About Nothing|The War|Look, I just want to make you better I think I could save you But I think I'm bipolar. I love you then I hate you Grew with disdain though I hate whoever ain't you Hate when I can't date you but I also need my space too I made room for this love. How foolish of me And every woman looking at you knew that you was lucky So check the verse miss. I ain't say I'm perfect But you was low on love, what I do; reimbursed it And now it hurts to be around or converse with ya And what’s worse is before this, I had worshiped you Now war missiles hand guns and grenades The walls I couldn't break em or take em apart with a tank Now momma told me be careful who you love G said just rap it up, these bitches actin up And as for us, we was different though. Things have gotten difficult Try to be Mr. perfect intercontinental, hold up You spend your time with your friends all the time And all that time with your friends put my momentum on decline My minds gone evil. You changed with the season You had a new clear heart. Guess I was Hiroshima So now I need some Xanies, some Remy, and some reefer So when this war is over I'm not PTSD'ing And I don't wanna leave her. But you know what got me wonderin' I'm scared to lose love but even more scared to love again Why we gotta argue Why we gotta fight I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right It's like we both forgot what we were fightin' for So tell me why are we at war [Seinfield Skit] Yea, they do whatever they want, whenever they want And nobody else can stop it I'm catching myself depositing these feelings she withdraw from And I ain't got the gall to tell my godzilla byebye So I'm hurting. Me effort is apparent she not fertile The anger I've adopted. The feelings been aborted So now I press ignore if ever Cupid tried to call up They call me better now. See when everything is stopped And your loves in hindsight and you see everything its not Notice everything it wasn't. Realizing why it shouldn't ever be again Cause in the end its not about what you put in Fuck kissing and hugging. They love pushing your buttons New love is so beautiful. Time just makes it ugly But fuck it I accept it. no longer will neglect it If a period is late then I will mark it with a question That mean I never trust em. And if you ever love them Know that favorite girlfriends turn into crazy baby mommas The war Now why we gotta argue. Why we gotta fight I just wanna love you. I wanna make it right It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for So tell me why are we at war? Just another product of this matrix This maze I'm in amazes me at times I just wanted to be at peace with you And if I gotta settle for a piece of you Then I gotta say peace to you With all due respect I do respect you enough to expect Effort is all I ask If we gonna last more, I gotta ask for more And if that means that I'm askin for too much I'm sure we'll end up as our last or...past We bash We blast We shoot We lose We pass.....war

Jay Z|In My Lifetime, Vol. 1|Streets Is Watching|[Produced by Ski Beatz] [Verse One] Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless But if you shoot me, then you're famous What's a nigga to do? When the streets is watching, blocks keep clocking Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted But my time is money, and twenty-five, I can't afford it Beef assorted like Godiva chocolates Niggas you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass This rhyme, you're operating on bitch time Y'all niggas ain't worth my shells, all y'all niggas Trying to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John Meneill' The type to start a beef then run to the cops When I see you in the street got one in the drop When I'd rather be on tour getting a hundred a pop Taking pictures with some bitches in front of the drop The streets is watching [Hook] When the, streets is watching Blocks keep clocking Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake Can't ignore it [Verse Two] Now it's hard not to kill niggas It's like a full time job not to kill niggas, can't chill The streets is watching When you froze your arms Niggas want to test you when your gun goes warm Can't get caught with your feet up, got to keep your heat up Sweet niggas running 'round swearing shit is sweeter Once you're tagged lame the game is follow the leader Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer Kidnap niggas want to steal you Broke niggas don't want no cash, they just want to kill ya For the name, niggas don't know the rules Disrespecting the game, want you to blow your cool Force your hand, of course that man's plotting Smarten up, the streets is watching, it's on [Hook] When the, streets is watching Blocks keep clocking Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake Can't ignore it [Verse Three] My street mentality: flip bricks forever Know me and money, we like armed co-defendants Nigga we stick together Shit whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground Hustle harder until secret indictment time came around And you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, that ain't me now Got a face too easy to trace, niggas mouths got slow leaks Had to hire a team of workers, couldn't play those streets See out of space like Mercury, you jerkin me? Hectic Had to call upon my wolves to send niggas the message I said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here I'm trying to transform you boys to men like daycare' Ay there's money to be made and niggas got the picture Stopped playing with my paper and we got richer Then hard times fell upon us Half of my staff had warrants The other half in the casket lay dormant I felt like life was cheating me For the first time in my life I was getting money But it was like my conscience was eating me Was this a lesson God teaching me? Was he saying that I was playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back? Like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mind frame bad? Was niggas thinking simplify was turning cocaine crack? Ain't a whole lot of brain to that Just trying to maintain a stack And not collide like two trains that's on the same track But get my life together like the oils I bring back In the bottom of the pot where the water gets hot Got my transporter take it across the border then stop To set up shop with a quarter of rock Here's the plan: For three straight weeks, niggas slaughtered the block But you know the game is food, it fucked up me and my dudes One drought can wipe a nigga out, faster than the cops And this unstable way of living just had to stop Half of my niggas got time, we done real things By '94 became the subject of half of y'all niggas rhymes Public apologies to the families of those caught up in my shit But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in this shit The life and times of a nigga mind, excited with crime And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind I figured, "shit, why risk myself I just write it in rhymes And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine?" The mind state of a nigga who boosted the crime rate So high in one city they send National Guards to get me

Aesop Rock|None Shall Pass|None Shall Pass|[Verse 1] Flash that buttery gold, jittery zeitgeist Wither by the watering hole, what a patrol What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly Not enough young in his lung for the water wings Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch Like, "I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt." Fine, sign of the time we elapse When a primate climb up a spine and attach Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines They get a rise out of frogs and flies So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life The mouths water on a fork and knife And the allure isn't right No score on a war-torn beach Where the cash cow's actually beef Blood turns wine when it leak for police Like, "That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!" [Hook] And I will remember your name and face On the day you are judged by the funhouse cast And I will rejoice in your fall from grace With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass." None shall pass, none shall pass [Verse 2] Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz ‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch And express no regrets Though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss To the jokers who pose by the glitz Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm When a king is a whore who comply and conform Miles outside of the eye of the storm With a siphon to lure out a prize and award While avoiding the vile and bazaar that is violence and war True blue triumph is more Like, "Wait, let him snake up out of the centerfold Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go." Sat where the old, cardboard city folk Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw [Hook] And I will remember your name and face On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast And I will rejoice in your fall from grace With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass." None shall pass, none shall pass [Interlude] You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help [Verse 3] Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this Duty and death; anyone object, come stand in the way You could be my little Snake River Canyon today And I ran with a chain of commands And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd When I cut a belly open to find what climb out That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up To make a dark horse rush, like, "Enough's enough!" It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff 'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck And it's a beautiful thing, to my people who keep an impressive wingspan even when the cubicle shrink You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed N.Y. Chew through the machine [Hook] And I will remember your name and face On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast And I will rejoice in your fall from grace With a cane to the sky, like, "None shall pass." None shall pass, none shall pass

Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up? Fuck that! This the fucking thanks I get For tryin to edutain assholes and feed my bitch? Yo, I feel like my whole life is upside down ‘Cause you seeing more support than I'm seeing my child [Verse 2: Eminem] It's like, every day I wake up, another drama It's a wonder I'm alive, surviving this karma If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her Without these cameras in our faces like animals For your Channel 2 Action News To follow our ambulance up the avenue And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts, and what we do in private, since they won't let us put up a fence And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun Whether it's unloaded, full or an unregistered one No bullets?

Just hit me on my tele' nigga soon as I touch down Spit lines to split spines, just to get mine Big behind bitches getting dick to spit shine Sniff lines of coke – that's the only shit that make you dope Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip And turn till you motherfuckers tell me the right shit [Verse 4: Eminem] So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself A front door with twelve locks And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops? Fuck that! I protect myself with these twelve shots And one in the chamber, gun in the waist And one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place Tryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not Gonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face And it's a disgrace Hailie can't play with her toys In the front yard, without you drivin' by, honkin' your horn Screamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' and shit or pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live So my address ends up on the Internet again So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs And reporters blow it out of proportion Oh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans Just for tryin' to stand on his porch And I'm the bad guy, ‘cause I don't answer my door Like, "Hey, hi! You guys wants some autographs? Okay, form a straight line!" Sometimes I feel like loading this rifle, and climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you It's not that I don't like you; it's just that when I'm not behind the mic, I'm a person who's just like you

I'm too weeded to speak to The only key that I see to defeat you Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse, you'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you (Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal I ain't tryin' to shoot you I'm tryin' to chop you into pieces and eat you Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin' mattress Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers Fuck the planet 'til it spins on a broken axis I'm so bananas I'm showing up to your open casket To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you, and smoke the ashes [Hook: J-Black] I see the light at the end But every time I take a step it gets dim Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in? If so, Heaven's got to be better But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down [Verse 2: J-Black] Am I the worst because I never go to church? I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse I'ma drink till my liver rot, see the doc leave the E.R Then hit a bar for a liquor shot; fuck the liver spot! One day we all gon' die But when I die, I'ma be so high That I'ma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare With the chalk outline still there I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot I got a cross on my chain, but it's just to rock Now if I pray every night Do I still have to hold my tre very tight? You feel me, God? I done did so much shit while on Earth I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face Nickle 9 at my waist, God done lost faith Angels greet me, but I don't reply back Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at? [Hook: J-Black] I see the light at the end But every time I take a step it gets dim Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in? If so, Heaven's got to be better But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down [Interlude: Announcer] Maxi was seriously wounded But the soul still burns Final battle, fight! [Verse 3: Masta Ace] Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag and I drag her Ten blocks, untie the bitch, and I still bag her Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel My flows spill, like using the wrong end of a funnel Everyday I grow more older and more colder Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a boulder I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare, ‘cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care [Hook: J-Black] I see the light at the end But every time I take a step it gets dim Tell me, is this Hell we're livin' in? If so, Heaven's got to be better But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down [Outro: Announcer] Time's up! You lose!

Eminem|The Slim Shady EP|Murder, Murder|[Hook] All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate Murder-murder-murder and kill-kill-kill [Verse 1] Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydrating Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waiting Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escaping I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan Maybe I need my head inside straightened, brain contemplating Clean out the register, dip before somebody catches ya Or gets your description and sketches ya Then connects you as the prime suspect But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet Cause I got a daughter to feed And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring Money from the safe in the back, stepped in waving the Mac Co-operate, and we can operate, and save an attack This bitch tried escaping the jack, grabbed her by the throat It's murder she wrote, you barely heard a word As she choked, it wasn't nothing for her to be smoked Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke Just then the pigs bust in yelling: "Freeze!" But I'm already wanted for selling ki's And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spelling bees So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees I bust shots, they bust back Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearing a vest [Hook] All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate Murder-murder-murder and kill-kill-kill [Verse 2] Left the house, pulling out the drive backing out Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blacking out Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face: "Shut your yacking mouth 'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!" Drug her by her hair, smacked her up Thinking fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up Stole her car and made a profit, grabbed the tape from out the deck And lost it out the window like the girl in Set It Off did Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimming pool Climbed out and collapsed on the patio I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though Parents screaming, "Johnny go in and call the police Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace" Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff Acting like they never seen nobody hit a lick before Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64 When they sell out in stores the price triples I ran up the block jumping kids on tricycles And collided with an 80-year-old lady with groceries There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties Stood up and started to see stars Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars Barely escaped, must'a been some dumb luck Jumped up and climbed the back of a moving dump truck But I think somebody seen me maybe Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must'a dropped a Beanie Baby Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits Came out with a white flag hollering "truce-truce" And surrendered my weapon to cops Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps [Hook] All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate Murder-murder-murder and kill-kill-kill

Slick Rick|The Great Adventures of Slick Rick|Children's Story|[Produced by Slick Rick] [Intro] Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story? Please, huh, please? Alright, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook Y'all tucked in? [Verse 1] Here we go Once upon a time not long ago When people wore pajamas and lived life slow When laws were stern and justice stood And people were behavin' like they ought ta good There lived a lil' boy who was misled By another lil' boy and this is what he said: "Me and you, Ty, we gonna make some cash Robbin' old folks and makin' tha dash" They did the job, money came with ease But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease He robbed another and another and a sista and her brotha Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic He said "Keep still, boy, no need for static" Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped The kid pulled out a gun, he said "Why did ya hit me?" The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure "I'll do years if I pull this trigga" So he cold dashed and ran around the block Cop radioes it to another lady cop He ran by a tree, there he saw this sista A shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her Looked around good and from expectations So he decided he'd head for the subway stations But she was coming and he made a left He was runnin' top speed till he was outta breath Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him Then he made his move to an abandoned building Ran up the stairs up to the top floor Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? Dave the dope fiend shootin' dope Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap He said "I need bullets, hurry up, run!" The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun He went outside but there was cops all over Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova Raced up the block doing 83 Crashed into a tree near university Escaped alive though the car was battered Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered Ran out of bullets and still had static Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead He told the cops "Back off or honey here's dead" Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong So he let the lady go and he starts to run on Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded And before long the little boy got surrounded He dropped his gun, so went the glory And this is the way I have to end this story He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh Just another case about the wrong path Straight 'n narrow or yo' soul gets cast Good night [Outro] (Knock him out the box, Rick Knock him out, Rick) 1: Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird 2: I know right what does he mean by “Straight ‘n narrow or yo’ soul gets cast" 1: I don’t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something 2: Well, good night 1: Good night

This is our final hour Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six-teen Million people, all equal at this high pitch Maybe we can reach al-Qaeda through my speech Let the President answer a higher anarchy Strap him with an AK-47, let him go Fight his own war, let him impress Daddy that way No more blood for oil We got our own battles to fight on our own soil No more psychological warfare To trick us to thinking that we ain't loyal If we don't serve our own country We're patronizing a hero; look in his eyes, it's all lies The stars and stripes have been swiped Washed out and wiped And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why ‘Cause I told you to fight!

[Outro: Eminem] And as we precede to mosh through this Desert Storm And these closing statements If they should argue, let us beg to differ As we set aside our differences and assemble our own army To disarm this weapon of mass destruction That we call our President, for the present And mosh for the future of our next generation To speak and be heard. Mr. President! Mr. Senator! [Over outro] "Go left, go left, go left, right, left" "Go left, go left, go left, right, left" [Kids] Can you guys hear us? *laughs*

Canibus|Rip the Jacker|Levitibus|[Intro: TV Sample] "You want power...but you're not big enough So you steal it piece by piece, tainted and spoiled And you're weak... step by step you'll weaken and the power...." [Verse 1: Canibus] I harness the power of the chakra Remote viewing into dolphins, describing what I see in the process Are stone statues surrounded by Neolithic objects Geoglyphs on the Pampa A dose of [?] makes it feel like a dream The dream state is the playground for the supreme Critics attempt to follow a trend Today they call me a charlatan but tomorrow I will be a God of men To create a universe all I need Is one thousand trillion trillion degrees Sodium 22, betatrons and a cloud chamber Keep the noise down so I don't arouse my neighbors Got a message from the Falcon and the Snowman In an unopened Coca-Cola can Showed the whole plan in coded program Encrypted by a ProScan modem with a low band Hold up, let me load it in [Hook - samples from Outer Limits and "Exertions (Remix) by Jedi Mind Tricks] "Put a curse on you" "You want to take over" “You clash with cyanide gas and die fast” "Another mystery" "Are you gonna put a curse on me" "There's no need" “Rhythmical equivalent of solids, liquids and gas” [Verse 2: Canibus] I was created by intelligent design You are merely a descendant of the unmodified You diss me out of pride, but when you're finished Talking about money and bitches you're simply out of rhymes Even my worst album was sublime If I don't slow down, I'll distort the timeline Back through the time tunnel to a 100 Bars again A master like the honorable Earl of Carnarvon The grand architect Used to be a partisan to Lamarckism theory but I lost the bet No regrets, you live and you learn I'm through giving advice, I just give concern Sterilize my hands to prevent catching the germs And try to rebuild all the bridges I've burned I prefer modesty over controversy But what am I to do when these jerks keep bothering me Jealous because they can't rhyme like me And they never had a scientific mind like me [Hook] [Verse 3: Canibus] I'm above average with verbal semantics The Aurora Borealis in the form of a rap ballad You look at me like, "Poor bastard, why can't you Manipulate billboards with all your metaphor magic?" No matter how hard I practiced, every microphone I saw I grabbed it, obviously that's the wrong tactic I went through a long period of mourning and sadness When I wrote that Stan shit But if you wanna see some hardcore Canibus just say so And I'll come out the egg roll with seven dead scrolls If you can find a better flow? Then I can find a dinosaur on the Galapagos archipelago Hey, you shouldn't fall for the naivete Lyrically I'm the illest when my beats is OK Food for thought, nutrition for the whole brain Keep your neurotransmitters warm on a cold day I'm ahead of my time or so they say I guess that's why I already feel old and grey OK, that's enough knowledge for today, I'm killing them You better not forget it cause this is Levitibus [Hook]

Immortal Technique|Revolutionary Vol. 2|Industrial Revolution|[Intro] Yeah nigga, Immortal Technique, metaphysics [Verse 1] The bling-bling era was cute but it's about to be done I leave ya full of clips like the moon blockin' the sun My metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch Like an escape tunnel in prison I started from scratch And now these parasites wanna percent of my ASCAP Tryin' to control perspective like an acid flashback But here's a quotable for every single record exec "Get your fuckin' hands out my pocket nigga" like Malcolm X But this ain't a movie, I'm not a fan or a groupie And I'm not that type of cat, you can afford to miss if you shoot me Curse to heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts darkening dreams No one's as good as me, they just got better marketing schemes I'll lead you to your own destruction like sparkin' a fiend Cuz you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream And that's the primary reason that I hate ya'll faggots I've been nice since niggas got killed over 8-ball jackets And Reebok Pumps that didn't do shit for the sneaker I'm a heatseaker with features that'll reach through the speaker And murder counter-revolutionaries personally Break a thermometer and force feed his kids mercury A&R's tried jerking me thinking they call shots Offered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox You're all getting shot, you little fucking treacherous bitches [Hook] This is the business, and ya'll ain't getting nothing for free And if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company You can call it reparations or restitution Lock and load nigga, industrial revolution [Verse 2] I want fifty three million dollars for my calloused hands Like the Bush administration gave to the Taliban And fuck packing grams nigga, learn to speak and behave You wanna spend twenty years as a government slave? Two million people in prison keep the government paid Stuck in a six by eight cell alive in the grave I was made by Revolution to speak to the masses Deep in the club toast the truth, reach for you glasses I'll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards Innocent deep in a casket, Colombian fashion Intoxicated off the flow like thugs passion You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blastin' You're better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion You're better off begging for twenty points from a label You're better off battling cancer under telephone cables Technique chemically unstable, set to explode Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in code So if your message ain't shit, fuck the records you sold Cause if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck Stuck in the underground, a general that rose to the limit Without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick Revolutionary Volume 2, murder the critics And leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets [Hook]

The Beatles|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|A Day in the Life|[Verse 1] I read the news today, oh boy About a lucky man who made the grade And though the news was rather sad Well I just had to laugh I saw the photograph He blew his mind out in a car He didn't notice that the lights had changed A crowd of people stood and stared They'd seen his face before But nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords I saw a film today, oh, boy The English Army had just won the war A crowd of people turned away But I just had to look Having read the book I'd love to turn you on [Verse 2] Woke up, fell out of bed Dragged a comb across my head Found my way downstairs and drank a cup And looking up I noticed I was late Found my coat and grabbed my hat Made the bus in seconds flat Found my way upstairs and had a smoke And somebody spoke and I went into a dream [Verse 3] I read the news today, oh boy 4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire And though the holes were rather small They had to count them all Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall I'd love to turn you on [Instrumental Outro]

Joe Budden|Mood Muzik 4: A Turn 4 The Worst|Black Cloud|[Intro] Nothing stays the same forever Not even me! Check this Check It [Verse 1] Something must’ve changed me, niggas might defame me But things that used to tame me, no longer seem to restrain me Strangely I’m no longer sad, mad or angry Shame-ably it pains me, feeling like it just ain’t me Mainly what do I tell all the people that thank me Namely those who ordain me, aside from can you blame me Motivation the "Game" was supplying me it's no longer providing me Jason Williams something killed whatever was driving me Worrying less about the past more about the now Less about what I’m going through more about the how It’s for certain spent 30 years being fit for hurdling Now I’m a different person with nothin' to overcome and I miss the burden For certain, got 6 figures in my sock drawer And honestly this year I expect to make a lot more It’s hard to live without a budget when life is corrupted In a house that's so peaceful that I’m trying to disrupt it Scream fuck it not because I have to but because I love it Which makes me as fake as the puppets that I speak of disgusted Without a paddle up shit’s creek Dig deep and see it ain’t life it’s just me So be warned as I’m putting on like I’m reformed Only so y’all can accept it as being my norm Maybe I quit working on me, maybe I given up Maybe I been lying to myself maybe I give a fuck [Hook] It’s enough to make you black out, pull a Mac out Aim it at the sky while I’m running from the black cloud Every day we playing cat-and?-mouse As I watch it hovering over my glass house It’s enough to make you spazz out, pull a Mac out Aim it at the sky while I’m running from a black cloud Tired enough for me to pass out, tired of running from the black cloud [Verse 2] I say it loud hoping someone can hear me clearly Trying to make my girl get it she don’t know that it’s very scary But she’s a nympho she can be barely near me She still want the God in her, think she Mary Mary The prettiest bitches just want to service me While niggas' prettiest bitches wouldn’t get a word from me Some of you haven’t heard from me, some of you wouldn’t mind murking me Find that news funny likes its straight from Ron Burgundy These niggas ain’t never seen dough They can dream though I bump into ‘em in between shows People say I'm Emo, what that really mean though Is though the song can’t breathe I actually make it seem so I lost loved ones because they couldn’t deal with me Cherish whoever still with me though the merit's been killed in me Normally it’s just me and my lonely mind Everyone storm is different so this forecast is only mine Fans recognize my misery uplifted me Shifted me to my epitome, guess the curse is a gift to me Maybe its serendipity, maybe it’s weighing on me physically Maybe I should man up and tell God not to solicit me Been medicated, meditated, sedated, hated Character assassinated, all theses years I masqueraded Hard headed, if it was on my mind I had to say it Tongue on the devil’s pitchfork to see how disaster tasted Rap is fabricated, rappers are so exaggerated Wouldn’t be scared of the truth if they weren’t castrated Grab a mag, spray it, surrounded by people that shoot it before me That'll unconditionally love my beautiful ugly Now lemme speak to who I cater to Would you love me the same if all my weeks were not favorable Promised to maintain being unique but relate-able All while suffering from a disease that can do away with you Poetry on the beat, spoken-word for the masses Therapy over Pro-Tools, every word is on acid Consonants on Kush, every vowel is blunted Highly wanted this whole organization privately funded This is bigger than the Eiffle, this is alert the public Had coppers bar our tunnels and our bridges with the rifles Sentences meant to stifle, this is a man aching This is the dam breaking, contraband in the making This is panic unveiling, got potential but I never met it He be trying to come over, it seem like God won’t let it Either he never got my invite or he just dismissed it But if all I’m hearing are the sounds of blackness, why am I pessimistic? You’ll never progress if you’ll never try All I ask, let every word I birth, never die My wings spread, but when I met the sky Weather didn’t change like I thought and had me petrified [Hook] It’s enough to make you black out, pull a Mac out Aim it at the sky while I’m running from the black cloud Every day we playing cat-and?-mouse As I watch it hovering over my glass house It’s enough to make you spazz out, pull a Mac out Aim it at the sky while I’m running from a black cloud Tired enough for me to pass out, tired of running from the black cloud

MF DOOM|Operation: Doomsday|Red & Gold|I remember when, last past November when Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands They left him trembling, he was not remembering: Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem Some would debate you, "Wait, the fella ate gelatin Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him" When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling Us to break them off, no reassembling No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the scripts Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail 700 volts holds rap to a standstill Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze [And the lights went down and hey!] And I knew it was the last day ... Wig-Twisting Season When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason Mostly with these crimes of treason And you'll be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening From how he's feeling, thrilling choice of flow is sick He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack It don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple 'Cept the nipple little. Just hot off the griddle Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self Ain't no average MC ahead of me Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree With nicknames, sick games as Rick James Messy games, sci-fly such as Jesse James Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker Got bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up Bail out quick for the 7:30 wake-up My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday All else? Worthless to say (And the lights went down and hey!) That's when I knew it was the first day ... Wig-Twisting Season When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning Mostly with these crimes of treason men And y'all be lucky if there's no squeezing even this evening It's like a mosquito, the much sweeter resent the act I been bent back since my Physical went back Since, Cultured more of my kin And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole Hold your head, use your head and hold, or be dead and cold In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold To 'round Nimrod release day And all else? Needless to say Wait a motherfucking minute!! true facts presented The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it The XP was three-quarters tinted, 4/5ths was converted The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted ... Wig-Twisting Season When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning Mostly with these crimes of lying, and fronting, and cheating All types of different styles of treason

MF DOOM|Operation: Doomsday|Hey!|[Produced by MF DOOM] [Intro] Good evening, ladies and gentlemen (Hey!) I'd like to thank you all for joining us this evening Let me know if y'all with me y'all (Hey!) Just a couple of things I'd like to say.. I only play the games that I win at And stay the same with more rhymes than there's ways to skin cats As a matter of fact, let me rephrase: With more rhymes and more ways to fillet felines these days Watch the path of the black one: Supervillian. He wrecks clubs for delf In a drunken stupor chillin Ready and willin to inadvertantly foil that Plan of any rhymer, whiner or spoiled brat Who got more snottier flows than snotty nose? And holds mics like he knows karate body blows? Nobody knows The trouble I see From the MPV fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty For the record this is some shit I just thought of y'all Science fiction that's not admissable in no court of law I live to rock mics 3-D The only reason I seek to stop: to snuff the TV I heard beats, they sound like karaoke With monkey rhymers on a leash like don't have this fairy choke me Hit 'em with a penny so we can get these peanuts And I thought we was nuts, I used to get free cuts They locks Lex Luthor up in green haven Since when a nigga never really been to clean shaven Misbehavin rap stars need Listamint Call me Mista Bent I'm at where your sister went Intelligent, used to write and be well spoke Now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell (HEY!), tell a joke This could lead to catastrophe Bout to stop the violence Right after these last three shots from the black bat got me at headlock Holdin on to sanity, by strands of that dreadlock She told me get off I said: "Bitch!! Let me set this shit off so I could get rich right quick" Then it hit me like the point of intoxication Nigga come out and rock this nation like ox defacin' A lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation In the world's most strangest most dangerous occupation But you could do it, you the Super like in your building Villian like trife Kinder is in All My Children Plottin And it sure to pay ends With some real mature womens, and more of they friends And when bad men roll tight, it's actual true Like a pack of Big Bambú, with natural glue Who grip necks of Becks next to triple X? He just came in 4D: Follow the ripple effects! And it'll lead you right to him Oh snap! It seems you walked into a trap, through rap Zoinks! This place is filled with pretender willies One false move, and get broke off! like end of Phillies True believers Ain't nothin new to a Crook with special powers like how to tell the future uh-uh- Rhyme of the month two page long Bustin off two gages with my cape on wrong Son it's on remind me of a Raekwon tape song With a fleet of super bad... Status: Rae Dawn Chong Let me know if y'alls with me y'all! National and geographic down to the titty-bar Rep Monster Island City yall! To all my brothers who is doin' unsettling bids You could have got away with it if it was not for them Meddling kids! (OVERR HEERRE!)

C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it!

(Just let it go!) [Verse 1] Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space I'ma sit on top of the world, and shit on Brandy and Mase I'm more than ill Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill Human horror film, but with a lot funnier plot And people'll feel me, ‘cause I'ma still be the Mad Rapper Whether I got money or not As long as I'm on pills and I got plenty of pot I'll be in a canoe paddling, making fun of your yacht But I would like an award For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source And a wardrobe I can afford Otherwise I might just end up back strikin' at Ford And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for? Everybody's pissing me off Even the No Limit Tank looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off No shit, I'm a grave danger to my health; why else Would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself? [Hook] [Verse 2] I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth With a roll of quarters I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments I grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate Since the third time that I failed 9th grade You probably think that I'm a negative person Don't be so sure of it I don't promote violence, I just encourage it I laugh at the sight of death As I fall down a cement flight of steps And land inside a bed of spider webs So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend Can jump off of a bridge, and if you live, do it again Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now [Hook] [Verse 3] My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face And place the clip and cock it back And let it go until your brains are rippin' out your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off Where the fuck were you When Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash? I make a couple statements, and now look how crazy shit got You made me get a bigger attitude than 80 Kim Scotts And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got I knew that "Just the Two of Us" Would make you hate me this much And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us And our personal life, it's just words on a mic So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

T.S. Eliot|Prufrock and Other Observations|The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock|S’io credesse che mia risposta fosse A persona che mai tornasse al mondo, Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse. Ma perciocchè giammai di questo fondo Non tornò vivo alcun, s’i’odo il vero, Senza tema d’infamia ti rispondo. Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question … Oh, do not ask, “What is it?” Let us go and make our visit. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, And seeing that it was a soft October night, Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. And indeed there will be time For the yellow smoke that slides along the street, Rubbing its back upon the window-panes; There will be time, there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; There will be time to murder and create, And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate; Time for you and time for me, And time yet for a hundred indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions, Before the taking of a toast and tea. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. And indeed there will be time To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?” Time to turn back and descend the stair, With a bald spot in the middle of my hair— (They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”) My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin— (They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”) Do I dare Disturb the universe? In a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. For I have known them all already, known them all:— Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, I have measured out my life with coffee spoons; I know the voices dying with a dying fall Beneath the music from a farther room. So how should I presume? And I have known the eyes already, known them all— The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, Then how should I begin To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways? And how should I presume? And I have known the arms already, known them all— Arms that are braceleted and white and bare, [But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!] Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress? Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. And should I then presume? And how should I begin? Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows?… I should have been a pair of ragged claws Scuttling across the floors of silent seas. And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! Smoothed by long fingers, Asleep … tired … or it malingers, Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me, Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter, I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter; I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid. And would it have been worth it, after all, After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, Would it have been worth while To have bitten off the matter with a smile, To have squeezed the universe into a ball To roll it toward some overwhelming question, To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”— If one, settling a pillow by her head, Should say: “That is not what I meant at all, That is not it, at all.” And would it have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worth while After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor— And this, and so much more?— It is impossible to say just what I mean! But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: Would it have been worth while If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, And turning toward the window, should say: “That is not it at all, That is not what I meant, at all.” No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be; Am an attendant lord, one that will do To swell a progress, start a scene or two, Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool, Deferential, glad to be of use, Politic, cautious, and meticulous; Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse; At times, indeed, almost ridiculous— Almost, at times, the Fool. I grow old … I grow old … I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. I do not think that they will sing to me. I have seen them riding seaward on the waves Combing the white hair of the waves blown back When the wind blows the water white and black. We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown Till human voices wake us, and we drown.

She says, "Bill Gates." What are ya born 77 or 78? She says, "Nah it goes way to an earlier date Slave times," claims the slaves said rhymes But she fell in love with some fella named Clive Who? "Clive Campbell from Sedgwick Ave, the Bronx." Now she shows me the cash I said who's Clive, don't play with me skirt She said Clive Campbell He's Kool Herc Ah-ha! Ah-ha! Listen up sweetheart Now we gettin somewhere As she's talking, she starts vanishing in thin air But before she dropped the money bag on the floor and died She said if you really love me I'll come back alive

M. Alexander|Ms. Alexander's ENG 250 Class (Fall 2015)|Mending Wall|Something there is that doesn't love a wall, That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it, And spills the upper boulders in the sun, And makes gaps even two can pass abreast. The work of hunters is another thing: I have come after them and made repair Where they have left not one stone on a stone, But they would have the rabbit out of hiding, To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean, No one has seen them made or heard them made, But at spring mending-time we find them there. I let my neighbor know beyond the hill; And on a day we meet to walk the line And set the wall between us once again. We keep the wall between us as we go. To each the boulders that have fallen to each. And some are loaves and some so nearly balls We have to use a spell to make them balance: 'Stay where you are until our backs are turned!' We wear our fingers rough with handling them. Oh, just another kind of out-door game, One on a side. It comes to little more: There where it is we do not need the wall: He is all pine and I am apple orchard. My apple trees will never get across And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him. He only says, 'Good fences make good neighbors'. Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder If I could put a notion in his head: 'Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it Where there are cows? But here there are no cows. Before I built a wall I'd ask to know What I was walling in or walling out, And to whom I was like to give offence. Something there is that doesn't love a wall, That wants it down.' I could say 'Elves' to him, But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather He said it for himself. I see him there Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed. He moves in darkness as it seems to me— Not of woods only and the shade of trees. He will not go behind his father's saying, And he likes having thought of it so well He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors."

Under section 37B of the contract signed by him, it states quite clearly that all offers shall become null and void if - and you can read it for yourself in this photostatic copy: [grabs a magnifying glass and reads] Willy Wonka: I, the undersigned, shall forfeit all rights, privileges, and licenses herein and herein contained, et cetera, et cetera...

You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir! The handling of a heart's a very delicate art cause it's paper thin One irrelevant thought that started out as a spark could be a poisonous dart That leaves a permanent mark, that's ice cold in the day and burns in the dark And makes you never wanna see her face again Tee-hee, what a place I'm in Lead me to the station A one-way ticket, don't look back One cold tear that froze and cracked A whole lot of pain I'm holdin' back Chav said, "Eff that, roll the sack" I said, "If my skull was cracked And blood ran out to the cul-de-sac That could not match me where I'm at" My memories flash me there and back Yup there goes me right there in black Holdin' hands, not starin' back She starts cryin' I start denying, it's my fault And I'm aware of that Man, in hindsight signs be glarin' back Where's the map to show you where you're at?

Don’t make a mistake in thinking that I’m telling you this was the beginning of the man on the Earth. Fifty thousand years ago is like telling you thirty days ago or ten days ago or five days ago, to the age of the universe.

Nas|It Was Written|If I Ruled The World (Imagine That)|[Produced by Rashad Smith & Trackmasters] [Intro: Nas] Life, I wonder Will it take me under? I don't know [Verse 1: Nas] Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin' Imagine going to court with no trial Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters No welfare supporters More conscious of the way we raise our daughters Days are shorter, nights are colder Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge If coke was cooked without the garbage We'd all have the top dollars Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers Just some thoughts for the mind I take a glimpse into time Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine" [Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] If I ruled the world (Imagine that!) I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in these last days and times) [Verse 2: Nas] The way to be, paradise like relaxin' Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon Armani Exchange deranged Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path The Villa house is for the crew, how we do Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches So many years of depression make me vision The better livin', type of place to raise kids in Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin' Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin' Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish Political prisoner set free, stress free No work release, purple M3's and jet skis Feel the wind breeze in West Indies I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities And reverse fiends to Willies It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa [Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] If I ruled the world (Imagine that!) I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in these last days and times) [Bridge] And then we'll walk right up to the sun Hand in hand We'll walk right up to the sun We won't land [Verse 3: Nas] You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler ‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich Still nobody want a nigga having shit If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit I push a Q-45 Infinit(i) It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies Strictly living longevity to the destiny I thought I'd never see, but reality struck Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck? [Hook: Lauryn Hill + (Nas)] If I ruled the world (Imagine that!) I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby Black diamonds and pearls (Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?) If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in these last days and times)

Kurtis Blow|America|If I Ruled The World|[Verse 1] If I ruled the world, was king on the throne I'd make peace in every culture, build the homeless a home I'm not running for Congress or the President I'm just here, to tell the world, how my story went You see - first it was a dream, I was living in Rome And then I moved to London, bought a brand new home And everywhere I went, I drew lots of attention Like a stretch limousine, one of those new inventions It took a few years 'fore the day had come But I was ruler of the world ranked #1 So I headed towards Washington to claim the crown Let the whole world know that, the King was in town As I arrived the crowd started to cheer And then someone yelled out, "The King is here!" So I headed toward stage, to make a speech About the new style of living I was gonna teach, uh-huh [Hook] If I ruled the world I'd love all the girls.. I love em love em baby! Black diamonds and pearls If I ruled the world [Verse 2] People started flowing as they reached for my hand I said, "Thank you for bringing me to the Promised Land But now I must go, say goodbye to everybody Tonight I'll see you all at my Super Dinner Party" And late that night, at my Super Dinner Party I was dancing to the beat and entertaining: "La-Di-Da-Di" The music started ending, it was time for a speech The crowd started sitting as I rose from my feet And this was once a dream; I explained to the crowd But now, I rule the world, and I feel, so very proud Excuse me please for stopping this show I just had to thank you all, huh, and me so My first day in office, the King on the throne I spent my first three hours on the telephone You know with newsmen reporters, and votes too I had so many calls, I didn't know what to do You know hours passed I continued to work I signed so many papers, my fingers started to hurt Then I shook off the pain, say this ain't no thing Cause there's nothing in the world like being #1 king! [Hook] {AJ Scratch cuts up the track for a bit} [Verse 3] Now I rule the world and now, I'm on top And I'm rolling with folks that could never be stopped And I'm here to let you know this is where I belong And to you sucker MC's that sing my song And it's a song that's strong about right and wrong And I'm rock it to you baby baby all night long And it's a song about love, and happiness In a world of peace, and you know that's fresh Now I'm the king and I want you to know That I'm the Master Blaster Rapper who's running the show And to all of you rappers in every country You better stop what you're doing and listen to me Cause we gotta stop war and use unity To fight crime and hunger and poverty Cause the African baby is dying overseas While you sucker mission politicians busting out Z's Huh, 20 million people all unemployed While the rich man try to play Pretty Boy Floyd While the working class just struggles hard Try to make ends meet against all odds While the poor man can't even deal with life You know he tried to escape, and smoked the coke on the pipe And it's time for a CHANGE, to a better way Cause the sun has GOTTA shine through the cloudy day So LISTEN UP world, while I teach this class And take heed to the message or we ain't gonna last Cause I know, the solution, is the contribution Of woman and man to just join the revolution That'll take your brain to a higher plane And help you deal in a world that's gone insane With the problems that I know we can stop From the ruler of the world and the man on top But the years went by, and time was up And the ruler of the world had ran out of luck And all the people at the time who said they were my friends Didn't know me when my job had come to an end The King who took my place was happy as can be He was running his mouth like, Muhammad Ali So I shook his hand calmly as I headed to the door On my way to the ghetto to treat once more

Nas|Distant Relatives|Africa Must Wake Up|[Hook] Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones -- Who are we today? Yeah, now [Verse 1 - Nas (+ Damian Marley)] The black oasis, Ancient Africa the sacred Awaking, the sleeping giant, science, art is your creation I dreamed that we could visit old Kemet Your history is too complex and rigid for some Western critics They want the whole subject diminished But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions We praise bridges that carried us over The battle fronts of Sudanic soldiers, the task put before us (Do you hear me now?) [Hook] [Verse 2 - Nas] Who are we today? The slums, diseases, AIDS We need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid So who are we today? We are the morning after, the makeshift youth The slaveship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter The ancestral lineage built pyramids America's first immigrants, the kings and daughters from Nile waters The first architect, the first philosophers Astronomers, the first prophets and the doctors were us, us [Bridge - Damian Marley] Now can we all pray? Each in his own way Teaching and learning We can work it out We'll have a warm bed We'll have some warm bread Shelter from the storm dread And we can work it out Mother nature feeds all In fameine and drought And though selfish in ways, not to share is out What's a tree without root? Lion without tooth? A lie without truth? You hear me out! [Chorus - x2, but the second one is: Africa must wake up The sleeping sons of Jacob What tomorrow may bring May some more love come Yesterday we were kings I tell ya young bloods The world is yours today...] [Bridge: K'naan x2] Dadyahow daali waayey, nabada diideen Oo ninkii doortay dinta, waadinka dillee Oo dal markii ladhiso, waadinka dunshee Oo daacad ninkii damcay, waadinka dooxee [Translation] Oh ye people restless in the refusal of peace And when a man chooses religion, aren't you the ones to kill him? And when a country is built, aren't you the one's to tear it down? And when one attempts to tell the truth, aren't you the one's to cut him down? [Guitar/Instrumental break] [Nas - talking] We want to thank y'all, everybody out there This is Nas, Damian Marley Distant Relatives We're all distant relatives, no matter where you from, where you live How near or far Africa, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel We're all fam, we're all distant relatives So that's why we came together -- one of the reasons Why myself and Damian came together Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa That's right, you too. And you The whole world! We're all family, we're just spread out all over the place So to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home! [Hook]

Eric B. & Rakim|Follow The Leader|No Competition|[Verse 1] Competition is none I remain at the top like the sun And I burn whoever come in the chambers of torture I caught ya You should have brought ya Neighborhood to support ya No one in my path can withstand Under pressure the wrath of a swift man You name the day, the grounds could be neutral Speak your piece, the feeling's mutual We can go topic from topic whenever I drop it Try to stop it In other words, what the brother heard He tried to catch it, but what occurred Was too much weight for one brain to take Try to concentrate maintain then elevate From gram to ounce from pound to pound The matter of weight can't hold my mind down Permanent damage, I do away with No time for fun, cause I don't play with competitors It's only one when I'm done Competition is none It's no competition [Verse 2] Competition is none I'm the sole survivor, emcees get live but I get live-r It ain't a Memorex, live in concert In every network, the R's the expert Whoever goes against causes friction Introduction, music, where's the mixing Ra will never die, soon they'll never try To beat or defeat me because whenever I Put poetry in motion From the Nile, then out to the ocean Three-fourths of water makes seven seas A third of land, 360 degrees I circulate and remain to rotate Seven days a week at a quick or a slow rate Be prepared whenever I come Competition is none It's no competition [Verse 3] Creator, the alpha.

William Blake|Songs of Experience|The Tyger|Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night: What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand dare seize the fire? And what shoulder, and what art Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And when thy heart began to beat What dread hand? & what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain? In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? What dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears And watered heaven with their tears Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee? Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night: What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

Bob Dylan|Blood on the Tracks|Shelter From The Storm|[Verse 1] 'Twas in another lifetime One of toil and blood When blackness was a virtue The road was full of mud I came in from the wilderness A creature void of form "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm" [Verse 2] And if I pass this way again You can rest assured I'll always do my best for her On that I give my word In a world of steel-eyed death and men Who are fighting to be warm "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm" [Verse 3] Not a word was spoke between us There was little risk involved Everything up to that point Had been left unresolved Try imagining a place Where it's always safe and warm "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm" [Verse 4] I was burned out from exhaustion Buried in the hail Poisoned in the bushes And blown out on the trail Hunted like a crocodile Ravaged in the corn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm" [Verse 5] Suddenly I turned around And she was standing there With silver bracelets on her wrists And flowers in her hair She walked up to me so gracefully And took my crown of thorns "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm" [Verse 6] Now there's a wall between us Something there's been lost I took too much for granted I got my signals crossed Just to think that it all began On an non-eventful morn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm" [Verse 7] Well the deputy walks on hard nails And the preacher rides a mount But nothing really matters much It's doom alone that counts And the one-eyed undertaker He blows a futile horn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm [Verse 8] I've heard newborn babies wailing Like a mourning dove And old men with broken teeth Stranded without love Do I understand your question, then Is it hopeless and forlorn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm" [Verse 9] In a little hilltop village They gambled for my clothes I bargained for salvation And she gave me a lethal dose I offered up my innocence And I got repaid with scorn "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm" [Verse 10] Well I'm living in a foreign country But I'm bound to cross the line Beauty walks a razor's edge Someday I'll make it mine If I could only turn back the clock To when God and her were born "Come in," she said, "I'll give you Shelter from the storm"

Holy Bible (KJV)|Genesis |Genesis 1|Genesis 1:1: In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. Genesis 1:2: And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Genesis 1:3: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. Genesis 1:4: And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness. Genesis 1:5: And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. Genesis 1:6: And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. Genesis 1:7: And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which [were] under the firmament from the waters which [were] above the firmament: and it was so. Genesis 1:8: And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. Genesis 1:9: And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry [land] appear: and it was so. Genesis 1:10: And God called the dry [land] Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that [it was] good. Genesis 1:11: And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, [and] the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. Genesis 1:12: And the earth brought forth grass, [and] herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed [was] in itself, after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. Genesis 1:13: And the evening and the morning were the third day. Genesis 1:14: And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years. Genesis 1:15: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. Genesis 1:16: And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also. Genesis 1:17: And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth. Genesis 1:18: And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that [it was] good. Genesis 1:19: And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. Genesis 1:20: And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl [that] may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. Genesis 1:21: And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. Genesis 1:22: And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. Genesis 1:23: And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. Genesis 1:24: And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. Genesis 1:25: And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that [it was] good. Genesis 1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. Genesis 1:27: So God created man in his [own] image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. Genesis 1:28: And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. Genesis 1:29: And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which [is] the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. Genesis 1:30: And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein [there is] life, [I have given] every green herb for meat: and it was so. Genesis 1:31: And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, [it was] very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

Holy Bible (KJV)|Ecclesiastes|Ecclesiastes 1|Ecclesiastes 1:1 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem. Ecclesiastes 1:2 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity. Ecclesiastes 1:3 What profit hath a man of all his labor which he taketh under the sun? Ecclesiastes 1:4 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. Ecclesiastes 1:5 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose. Ecclesiastes 1:6 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits. Ecclesiastes 1:7 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full: unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again. Ecclesiastes 1:8 All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing. Ecclesiastes 1:9 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun. Ecclesiastes 1:10 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us. Ecclesiastes 1:11 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after. The Experience of the Preacher Ecclesiastes 1:12 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem. Ecclesiastes 1:13 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith. Ecclesiastes 1:14 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit. Ecclesiastes 1:15 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered. Ecclesiastes 1:16 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge. Ecclesiastes 1:16 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit Ecclesiastes 1:17 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.

William Shakespeare|Sonnets|Sonnet 18 (Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?)|Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate: Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, And Summer's lease hath all too short a date: Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, And often is his gold complexion dimm'd; And every fair from fair sometime declines By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd: But thy eternal Summer shall not fade, Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest; Nor shall Death brag thou wanderest in his shade When in eternal lines to time thou growest:     So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,     So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

[Verse 1: Masta Ace] Listen closely, so your attention's undivided Many in the past have tried to do what I did Just the way I came off then, I'm gonna come off Stronger and longer, even with the drum off I keep on goin' and flowin' just like a river I got a whole lot to give so I'm-a give a Little at a time, new trails are blazin' Action is in effect, and always stays in Yeah, just like a shot from a cannon I am the man in charge and I've been plannin' A jam strong enough that it can lift your soul I'm the originator, and my rhymes are made of gold Once you hear the capital "A" rap, it'll stay With you for awhile, it won't go away Unless you force it, because it stays with you, my friend And if you toss it away, I'm-a hit ya again I project my voice so it's right in the crowd There's a sign at the door: no bitin' allowed And if you didn't read it I suggest you do so Or you'll be stranded, just like Crusoe Sleep if ya wanna, go 'head, get some shut-eye A man broke his jaw tryin' to say what I Say on the microphone, you shoulda left it alone Just for the record, let it be known That my ego's only partially grown And never will I ever condone biting in any form, yo I'm only warm That verse was the calm, now here's the storm [Hook:] Next up (Yo, I believe that's me) Craig G, light up the mic for the Symphony [Verse 2: Craig G] This jam is dedicated to all un-optimistics That thought I wasn't coming out with some exquisite rhymes But that's alright, cuz now I'm back To kill all the rumors and straighten the facts of me Not rockin' rhymes like I always used to But you jumped on the tip when you heard me and the Juice Crew You said, "Mmm mmm mmm, ain't that somethin? Yo Craig, I heard you in that jam, and it's pumpin'! I apologize. Oh yeah, and uh, can I have your autograph for me and my grandma?" That's how I'm livin': on surprise mode Don't even sleep, try not to keep your eyes closed Cuz if you do, when you awaken, your so-called spot will be taken I'll take you over like a greedy executive, cuz on the mic my prospective is To be the best in all rap events, and since I have a call, I call experience [Hook:] Next up...(Yo, I believe that's me) Kool G Rap, light up the mic for the Symphony [Verse 3: Kool G. Rap] Yo, Marley gives the slice, I get nice And my voice is twice as horrifying as Vincent Price Goes deep, till you fell in a spell of a sleep And while I'm countin' the money, you count sheep When G Rap strikes the mic, I recite the type of hype that you like That make the people unite I grip up hips and zip up lips, step on reps, you flip and wanna sip on my tip Take a deep breath, because you don't have another left Comin' back like I'm avengin' my brother's death Makin' veterans run for medicine Cuz I put out more lights in a fight than Con Edison Rip the damn cage like I'm on a rampage So if you want rage, I'mma make front page Read the headlines, suckers, todays the deadline Your head is way past bedtime Can't kill though. Solo. Cuz you're still all...soft like a pillow My rap is rougher than Brillo So fear me, don't dare dare me And don't compare me to him when you hear me Talk about a battle but you ain't yet ready for war Your metaphor sucks more than a whore You can't replace me, ice me or ace me Bass me, face me, slice me or race me Bite me or taste me -- I'll show you that I got force My rap burns your mouth like hot sauce Run for water while I break your tape recorder Serve the sucker: the order is manslaughter Another rapper, G Rap wrecks He's rated X, that means the boy is sex.

Yo, it's a small thing I rip many places on regular basis, and broken down mics were the only traces That I'd been there and there at the party The mic had my prints, and on it was a body So take caution. I'm not horsin' around in a throwdown, clown I'm takin' yours son So just acknowledge the way that I kicked it Cause if rap was a house, you'd be evicted And dismissed from the microphone, chokin' on a bone, cause Daddy's home And battlin' me is hazardous to your health So put a quarter in your arse, cause ya played yourself Like a game in the arcade. You need a far aid I'm walkin' the path that Allah made I'll attend and then begin to send a speech to reach and teach So just say when So I can let lyrics blast like a bullet My mouth is the gun; on suckers I pull it The trigger, ya figure, my pockets gettin' bigger Cause when it comes to money, yo, Grant's my nigga! You've got the groove, emcees, freeze, stand still, nobody move It's a sabotage, as I take charge. Don't barge, cause goddamn, I'm livin' large Like a giant. You're nothin' but a midget, a small digit You ain't hit it, forget it, quit it I reign superior, always takin' care o'ya No-frill rappers, you will evaporate, disintegrate, deflate to your fate As the great will dominate straight to the state Of reignin', gainin'. So put Kane in, that category Period. End of story [Outro:]

[Hook] This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name [Verse 1: Mike Shinoda] Mike He doesn't need his name up in lights He just wants to be heard whether it's the beat or the mic He feels so unlike everybody else, alone In spite of the fact that some people still think that they know him But fuck 'em, he knows the code It's not about the salary It's all about reality and making some noise Makin' a story, makin' sure his clique stays up That means when he puts it down, Tak's pickin it up, let's go [Verse 2: Tak] Who the hell is he anyway? He never really talks much Never concerned with status but still leavin' 'em star struck Humbled through opportunities given despite the fact That many misjudge him because he makes a livin' from writin' raps Put it together himself, now the picture connects Never askin' for someone's help, to get some respect He's only focused on what he wrote, his will is beyond reach And now it all unfolds, the skill of an artist [Verse 3: Ryu] This is twenty percent skill Eighty percent fear Be a hundred percent clear cause Ryu is ill Who would've thought he'd be the one to set the west in flames And I heard him wreck it with The Crystal Method, "Name Of The Game" Came back, dropped Megadef, took 'em to church I like "Bleach", man, why you have the stupidest verse? This dude is the truth, now everybody givin' him guest spots His stock's through the roof, I heard he fuckin' with S. Dot! [Hook] This is ten percent luck, twenty percent skill Fifteen percent concentrated power of will Five percent pleasure, fifty percent pain And a hundred percent reason to remember the name [Verse 4: Ryu] They call him Ryu The Sick And he's spittin' fire with Mike Got him out the dryer, he's hot Found him in Fort Minor with Tak Been a fuckin' nihilist porcupine He's a prick, he's a cock The type woman want to be with, and rappers hope he get shot Eight years in the makin', patiently waitin' to blow Now the record with Shinoda's takin' over the globe He's got a partner in crime, his shit is equally dope You won't believe the kind of shit that comes out of this kid's throat [Verse 5: Tak] Tak He's not your everyday on the block He knows how to work with what he's got Makin' his way to the top He often gets a comment on his name People keep askin' him, "Was it given at birth Or does it stand for an acronym?" No, he's livin' proof, got him rockin' the booth He'll get you buzzin' quicker than a shot of vodka with juice Him and his crew are known around as one of the best Dedicated to what they doin', give a hundred percent [Verse 6: Mike Shinoda] Forget Mike Nobody really knows how or why he works so hard It seems like he's never got time Because he writes every note and he writes every line And I've seen him at work when that light goes on in his mind It's like a design is written in his head every time Before he even touches a key or speaks in a rhyme And those motherfuckers he runs with, those kids that he signed? Ridiculous, without even trying, how do they do it?

Nas|Hip Hop is Dead|Black Republican|[Produced by L.E.S & Wyldfyer] [Intro: Jay-Z] & (Nas) I know you can feel the magic, baby Turn the motherfuckin' lights down Esco, whattup? (Whattup, homie?) I mean, it's what you expected, ain't it? Let's go… uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh Turn the music up in the headphones Uh, yeah, that's perfect (Yeah, right) Uh, we got to take our time and make a nigga wait on this motherfucker (Hahaha!) Make niggas mad and shit like Niggas usually just start rappin' after four bars, nigga, go in! Start dancin' in this motherfucker Yeah, (Yeah) we just come outta nowhere [Hook: Jay-Z] I feel like a black republican, money I got comin' in Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then" [Verse 1: Jay-Z] Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then, though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend We had covenant, who would've thought the love would end? Like Ice Cold's album, all good things Never thought we sing the same song that all hoods sang Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain You wouldn't bicker like the other fools talk, good game Never imagine all the disasters that one good reign Could bring! Should blame the game And I could, it's kill or be killed, how could I refrain? And forever be in debt, that's never a good thing To the pressure for success can put a good strain On a friend you call best, and yes, it could bring Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane Though we rehearsed it's just ain't the same When you put in the game at age sixteen Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and miss things Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching The root of evil strikes again, this could sting Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point This puts the ring in jeopardy – indefinitely [Hook: Jay-Z] [Hook: Nas] I feel like a black militant takin' over the government Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "Fuck it then" [Verse 2: Nas] I'm back in the hood, they like, "Hey Nas" Blowin' on purp, reflecting on they lives Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies Gray fives, hatah's wishin' our reign dies Pitch, sling pies, and niggas they sing, "Why"? Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs I'm standing on the roof of my building I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself Through the hoops of fire Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire Could it be the forces of darkness against hood angels of good that forms street politics? Makes a sweet honest kid, turn illegal for commerce To get his feet out of them Converse – that's my word [Hook: Jay-Z] [Hook: Nas]

Be the first to blast Remember Kato No longer with us; he's deceased Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets, now rest in peace Is there heaven for a G? Remember me So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears [Refrain] I!, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears... Lord!, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears [Verse 2] Now that I'm struggling in this business, by any means Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm having visions Of leaving here in a hearse, God can you feel me? Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain Show me some happiness again, I'm going blind I spend my time in this cell, ain't living well I know my destiny is Hell Where did I fail? My life is in denial and when I die Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears [Refrain] Lord!, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears... Lord!, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears [Verse 3] Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears I'm suicidal so don't stand near me My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer To embrace an early death, now there's nothing left There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest I'm barely standing, bout to go to pieces, screamin' peace And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it I had my mind full of demons trying to break free They planted seeds and they hatched, sparking the flame Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game No memories, just a misery Painting a picture of my enemies killing me, in my sleep Will I survive 'til the mornin' to see the sun Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come [Refrain] Lord! (God!), I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears... God!, I lost so many peers [Verse 4] And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide Seen drive-bys takin' lives, little kids die Wonder why as I walk by Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, getting high This ain't the life for me, I wanna change But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game I'm trapped inside a maze See this Tanqueray influenced me to getting crazy Disillusioned lately, I've been really wanting babies So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady Don't trust my lady cause she's a product of this poison I'm hearing noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys, can't take no more I'm fallin' to the floor; beggin' for the Lord to let me in To Heaven's door -- Shed so many tears [Refrain] Lord!, lost so many peers, and shed so many tears.. I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears.. Lord!, I suffered many years, and shed so many tears.. God!, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Eminem|Straight from the Lab|Canibitch|[Intro] (I, I wanna grow up too) "Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?" Here we go! [Verse 1] Now, once upon a time not long ago There was a little rapper about to blow But his album came, and it was not good I think it went lead or double copper-wood So these silly little fans, they were misled By a nerdy Internet computer hip-hop head "Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash." "Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass." Hey, mister, would you care to bear witness to The ass-whippin' I'm about to administer To this ass-kissin' little vaginal blister? Stanibus, little Marshall Mathers' sister And in this corner, we have the "Mr Not-Havin'-It," it's the Mad, sinister Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for This little antagonistic faggot Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya! [Hook] Canibitch, oh, Canibitch Wherefore art thou, Canibitch? Please tell me what happened with That style that you were rappin' with Canibitch, oh, Canibitch Are you from Los Angeles New York, or just a janitor From Canada? Oh, Canibitch [Verse 2] Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit Picture me, for a second, and imagine it Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin' when All of a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict Gets my dick harder than arithmetic And I know how you jealous ones envy I should've knew better from the first few letters you sent me The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like You respect me, like any other regular MC The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return None of the messages at Shady Records you left me The fourth letter: "Slim, you're really startin' to upset me." The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me So I went back and read the first few letters that said Some shit about a message you left Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A! This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay! Right away, I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre "We got a bogey," "Marshall, I'm on the way."

Oh, Dre, wait a minute, that's it! All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost We can fly over the border!" "Let's Go!" [whoosh] [So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed impact, grunt] "What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri." "Fuck it," keep goin', no time to waste "Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case." "Okay," fuck, now he's draggin' under the car "Oh well, only thirty more thousand miles!" Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryin' to conversate Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane' "He couldn't have fell off that hard." Ain't no way! What happened to the way you was rappin' When you was scandalous? That Canibus turned into a television evangelist! Plus, he raps with his regular voice [Four impacts] "What was that?" "Pet Shop Boys." So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done So I stabbed him twice, kept jabbin'—Christ! He won't die! This guy's like a battered wife! He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more But he won't fight back, I cracked his jaw Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!

Bite another line from Redman's song! Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm From a midget reaches out from under the car It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither! Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again "Compton!" "Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!" "Stomp him!" "Switch feet!" "Stomp him!" "Switch again!" "Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him! I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!" ("Ahh!") "Damn," "He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!" [Hook] Canibitch, oh, Canibitch Wherefore art thou, Canibitch? Please tell me what happened with That style that you were rappin' with Canibitch, oh, Canibitch Are you from Los Angeles New York, or just a janitor From Canada? Oh, Canibitch

I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin' How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him When I got home, I found she had tried to call me My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry) I tried to call the honey but her line was busy I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon [Trugoy the Dove] I received a call from Misses Sick herself I asked her how was she recoverin' her health She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute She wanted to talk serious, I said, "go ahead-shoot" She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip You're just mad he's your overseer at school No need to play him out like he's someone cruel She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self [Posdnuos] Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie I ask her what's her problem, all she says is "Where is he?" I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin' She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!” None of the kids could understand what was the cause All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over

Gang Starr|Moment of Truth|You Know My Steez|[Guru talking] That makes me know that we we we we're doing We had the right idea in the beginning And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate We what we do we update our formulas We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right) With the times and everything y'know So y'know the rhyme style is elevated The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier And it's always a message involved [Intro] The real (The real) Hip-hop (Hip-hop) MCing(MCing), and DJing (DJing), from your own mind (from your own mind,) You know? (you know?) I, I guess right now we should start the show [Verse 1: Guru] Who's the suspicious character Strapped with the sounds profound Similar to rounds spit by Derringers You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads ‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties While real MC's and DJ's are a minority But right about now, I use my authority ‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy The horror be when I return for my real people Words that split wigs hitting like some double Desert Eagles Sporting caps pulled low, and baggy slacks Subtracting all the rappers who lack Over Premier's tracks Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse So as I have in the past, I whoop ass Dropping lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that While the world's revolving, on its axis I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics The wilderness is filled with this So many people searching for false bliss I'm here with the skills you've missed The rejected stone is now the cornerstone Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home You know my steez [Hook] You know my steez Let 'em know, do your thing, dog Keep it live (Keep it live,Keep it live) To the beat y'all [Verse 2] The beat is sinister, Primo makes you relax I'm like the minister, when I be lacing the wax I be bringing salvation through the way that I rap And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power When the mic's within my reach, I'm feeling more power Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour It's often easier for one to give advice Than it is for a person to run one's own life That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight The apparatus gets blessed And suckers get put to rest No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess The wackness is spreading like the plague MC's lucked up and got paid But still can't make the fucking grade How many times are wannabe's gonna lie? Yo, they must wanna fry They can't touch the knowledge I personify I travel through the darkness, carrying my torch The illest soldier, when I'm holding down the fort (You know my steez) You know my steez [Hook] Let em know, do your thing y'all Keep it live (Keep it live) You know my steez Let em know, do your thing y'all Keep it live (Keep it live) You know my steez Let em know, do your thing y'all Keep it live (Keep it live) You know my steez Let em know, do your thing y'all Keep it live (Keep it live) The mic [Verse 3] On the microphone, you know that I'm one of the best yet Some punks ain't paid all of their debts yet Trying to be fly, riding high on the jet-set With juvenile rhymes, making fake-ass death threats Big deal, like En Vogue, here's something you can feel Styles more tangible, and image more real For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts When it's time to go all out you be like, "Damn, he flipped!" Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit Got the lyrical full clip, giving you a verbal asswhip Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one Known as Bald Head Slick why is the press all on my di-dick? My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a frigging riot Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas Yo, them motherfuckers are harrassable For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond The mic's either a magic wand Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb Then I grab your palm, no pulse, you're gone And if you thought we'd lose our niche In this rap shit, you way wrong I stay up, I stay on, shine bright, like neon Your song's pathetic, synthetic, like Rayon Fat beats, they play on, want dope rhymes, put me on Word is bond You know my steez

She said, "You don't need a phone to reach me Cause vocal thoughts lead to arguments." I'm sure you won't believe me If I said I was talkin' to God and shit But it's all legit, all of it So just listen to the way we talk and lift off with this She said, "I was eyeing you from afar From a star, I watched you from someone's car" The glare of light in that person's rear view When the wind blows, that means that I'm near you I said, "I hear you, miss. Wait, what's your last name?" She said, "Dess." I said, "God, You're a mess." Lets, talk and reflect. Walk with me Tell me how hard I've been blessed (Chorus) Show me who you are and I will do the same I will never do you wrong I know better than to hurt you I can't make mistakes I swear I love you more Than anyone can I think you understand me, baby (Verse 2) I said, "do you get mad when I talk about The bitches I done fucked in the past?" She said, "Nah, but there are ladies who do, so Don't get stuck in the past" I said, "God you taught me a lot, an awful lot But I feel awful, a lot." I sold my soul to myself, I'm so alone Over domes I go, with every poem thrown From my point of view, everything points to you But you point to me, humanity is annoying me She said, "You are far from a boy to me Your noise is sweet, no way you're annoying me Join the beat, become your own instrument I love you, and I'm watching. Listening Your negative thoughts are just me hugging you tighter Pressure makes you write hard, so fuck it, it's fire." (Chorus) Show me who you are and I will do the same I will never do you wrong I know better than to hurt you I can't make mistakes I swear I love you more Than anyone can I think you understand me, baby (Verse 3) "Don't leave me miss," I said As she walked from the bar She was off to the stars I was drunk from her potent presence No liquor involved but I was copacetic She beamed down and said "Your bars are my lullabies So hard, but calm and I love it, why? You're Charles Hamilton, but act like you're just another guy As if you don't reside up in the sky And you worry bout' goin' over nigga's heads And bitches fed, cause you said, they was givin' head I won't lie, you are brash with delivery But you're not one to dash from your inner beast Besides, I ask you for chivalry You have what you've given me It's mad elementary This kinda love can last for a century But you're Charles and your passion is history Forever." (Chorus) Show me who you are and I will do the same I will never do you wrong I know better than to hurt you I can't make mistakes I swear I love you more Than anyone can I think you understand me, babyL

Charles Hamilton|It's Charles Hamilton|The Honeymoon's Over|(Intro) I swear this is the realest love song I have ever written It's not a love song, it's a real song Uh It's Charles Hamilton Blame me, right? Shit (Verse 1) Well well, Here we are. Another argument Yeah I know. It's my fault. I always start this shit This some retarded shit. Calling bitches yamps on my blog and shit Why do I think that's not the heart of it? You have a problem with you, not me. Cause you got me I need you aqui. I look at other women, and it's you I see I do not need to be abused by thee You do shit for my attention. It's senseless You're mine period. Check the end of the sentence. Simone Took up so much space in my dome, I forget my own face when I roam I'm more now. Star time. Hard times have passed me I'm the driver. Crying time is in the back seat So why do you insist on being in the back with me? And you get tight when other women wanna ask for me (Verse 2) Before I met you I caught mad bodies You mad probably, but they mad they ain't got me Copy, I told your ass sit there cocky, but nah. You wanna black And now you wanna chat with some otha' niggas Sending texts with the phone I bought you I know you ain't showing them tricks that I taught you Going to see them niggas in the shit that I bought you If I wasn't Charles, I would flip an Ike on you This is my heart you playin' around with When niggas I eye-ball you, they want a round fist But you're not use to the attention I guess As if your hands ain't on that beating shit in my chest Bitch I'm obssesed. Getting a rest Turnin' down celebs. Burn an ounce to the head I'm certain I'm about to just let go. But no, I love you But being alone is something that I can adjust to (Verse 3) Keep promisin' you gon' be better Cause you know me better On some OD letter But I feel so alone sometimes Which you, so much so, I bet you think I wrote this shit against you This instrumental was made out of pain, that you caused Bitch stay out my brain. Stay in my heart. I gave you a part Love 2.0, I'm state of the art. The only thing that changed is the way that I talk Everyday in my thoughts. How could you say that I'm lost? You call me selfish. Shit I was before I met you I let you in, how could you not feel special? Don't wanna hurt you, feels like I might. To be real, I can fight But I'm a man, kinda flyy. If something does happen, blame it on rap You can hate me, I'm whack. But I'mma still say (Baby come backk) Tough love Tough enough I love you Charles Hamilton One

If you ain't peep the trend by now with each rap I go up Look all he wanted was a deal so when he got it he just faded But tell me what's a deal when you want to be the greatest? So Jay I appreciate it, hell of a stepping stone Wonder if he see it in my eyes I'm trying to get the throne Wonder if the people know how many nights I spent alone Making beats writing rhymes, thinking deep fighting time I'm getting better but wasn't getting younger And all that time can make the most confident nigga wonder But never doubt it or allowed that shit to phase me yo Just switch my thoughts up like the stations on the radio nigga now I am [Hook] And they ask and they ask and they ask and I tell them It's the Fayettenam Put your glasses and your glasses and your glasses to the sky This is the last call for alcohol This is the warm up! So get your back up off the wall [Verse 2] Now may I never slip up or let my grip up I know my girl be praying Lord just keep his pants zipped up - Now if some groupie bitch is on his dick then make it's stiff up, at least give the nigga common sense to wrap his dick up Toast, let’s lift up, our glasses then sip up We fly past they look up They don't last they give up They don't blast we clip up then empty And indeed we hit the target yes these niggas think they the shit and they ain't even farted yet Style incomplete like a garbage ass quarterback My offense is for real, ay fuck sack, niggas getting coffined in the Ville Way too often and it feels wrong New York niggas fuck with me, I got 'em singing Ville songs Guess it's only right because we grew up singing they shit Big shit, Mase shit, Nas shit, Jay shit Time for a Carolina nigga to take his place with the greats A slim nigga making bold statement Uh, ay J. Cole how you do that there? I hear you blowing up my nigga I'm like, true that yea In NY but smile everytime I flew back there That Carolina, Fayettenam oh yea my crew back there I go home been so long they saying, you back here? - Took a turn for the worst boy don't move back here Don't do that, yo who dat? He rep the Ville when he spit it told you he be back with a record deal and he did it Nigga, fuck spinning on my pivot homie, I'm finna travel till 'refs blow the whistle on me I got a whole fucking city that's just sitting on me But it fits on my back, my state is sitting on that Will I drop? I think not I get up while they stop-like a sleeve on tank tops They ain't give it all they got so they flop So hey watch, how I'm finna take their spot Now I'm starting and they not-let me show you how to stay hot I play not, man I'm killing em even your idols feeling em dog The same nigga used to chill in the mall While they were still in the mall, I was up there spilling my rap The hero fighting villians just to put the Ville on the map [Hook] [Outro] Yeah man so shit, this was The Warm Up Uhm, what can I say, what can I say? If you heard The Come Up that was about just a lil nigga from North Carolina man Fayettnam to be exact Moved to NYC, chasing the dream I used college, if ya'll niggas don't know, I used college as a tool to get to New York I ain't have no family up here or nothing like that, I came up here on a scholarship, nigga went to college And the whole time I ain't even think I would have to finish college, I just thought I'd be signed by my freshman year so I wouldn't have to finish college But it didn't happen like that obviously, a nigga graduated and things started falling into place I got more focused, I dropped The Come Up And I look at The Come Up like, how kinda like how I was in high school Just picture this, The Warm Up is about a nigga, who did not make the team when he tried out and I know it's a lotta niggas who know that feeling man You try out, you think you deserve to be one the team and you go that day to look at the cut-list You wake up and you can't even sleep, you're like, "damn I'm gon' make the team, I did my thing at tryouts." You go to the list. All the niggas is looking at their names on the list, some niggas is like, "Aww shit I see my name nigga I'm good, I'm good nigga I'm good, I see my name." And you're looking for your name, and you kinda play in the back, tryna wait for niggas to clear out cause you're not sure And you go to the list and your name ain't there And you're like, "How the fuck did I not make this team? I'm better than him, I'm better than him, I'm better than him." So a lotta niggas either quit or some niggas go harder and so that's kinda how I took the rap shit when I put out The Come Up Cause ever since I was 15 I thought I was supposed to be signed But you know, shit, everything happens for a reason So shit fast forward to The Warm Up, this just me, like you know, me being that nigga that's practicing and making sure it's no way, it's undeniable that when I go to tryouts, there's no fucking way the coach is passing up on me my nigga So that's what this whole mixtape was about and lo and behold, you know As I'm finishing the mixtape, the deal comes Thank God, I'm blessed. Everything happens for a reason. And it couldn't have been with a more fucking, with a better fucking squad You know the niggas I got on the squad if you listen to this then you might have heard who I signed with, I ain't even gon' blast it off like that Shoutouts to, you know, Mark Pitts definitely Shoutout to my nigga Mike Rooney, my nigga E, shoutout to my whole fucking crew man That's The Warm Up is about man RG what's good, Mike Shaw, my nigga Mez, Mez held me down nigga More than anybody in the whole fucking, in the whole crew, honestly So shit, let's get it man We got a lotta shit for '09, '010, '011, '0 goddamn 35 That's all I got man, that's The Warm Up I made the team So when you go from making the team, now what you gotta do nigga you gotta start You gotta be a starter, you gotta make it to college You gotta make it from college to the league nigga Trust me, I ain't get no deal and fucking relax man I feel like I ain't made it yet period nigga And that's all I really gotta say yo, it's The Warm Up Thank you for listening man Yeah

Jay Z|The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse|Meet The Parents|[Intro] Woo! Uhh, uhh It's The Gift and the Curse Uhh, uhh, yeah First they love me, then they hate me, then they love me again They love me again Let's take a trip down I gotcha [Verse] Let's take a trip down memory lane at the cemetery Rain, grey skies, seems at the end of every Young black life is this line, "Damn, him already? Such a good kid," got us pourin' Henn' already Liquor to the curb for my niggas up above When it cracks through the pavement, that's my way of sendin' love So, give Big a hug, tell Aaliyah I said hi Till the next time I see her, on the other side He was just some thug that caught some slugs And we loved him cause, in him we saw some of us He walked like us, talked like us His back against the wall, nigga fought like us, damn Poor Isis, that's his mama name Mama ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name? Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him Hot temper, mama said he act just like her husband Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him Isis blamin' herself, she wish she could've saved him Damn near impossible, only men can raise men He was his own man, not even him can save him He put his faith in a thirty-eight in his waist But when you live by the gun, you die by the same fate End up dead before thirty-eight, and umm That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away Isis' life just ended on that rainy day When she got the news her boy body could be viewed Down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, sippin' brew Angel dust, dipped in WOO! She slipped into her own fantasy world Had herself pregnant by a different dude But reality bites and this is her life He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife It was just this night when moon was full And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight Had her soundin' like Lisa Lisa, I wonder if I take you home Will you still love me after this night? Mike was the hardhead from around the way That she wanted all her life, shit, she wanted all the hype Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike He was a Willie all her life, he wasn't really the one to like It was a dude named Sha who would really treat her right He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life But Isis liked this Broadway life She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red, green, and whites Hangin' out the window when she first seen him fight She was so turned on that she had to shower twice How ironic it would be some fight that Turned into a homicide that'll alter their life See, Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice Sure he saw him as an infant, but he disowned him like "If that was my son, he would look much different See I'm light-skinned and that baby there's dark" So it's mama's baby, papa's maybe Mike was still crazy out there runnin' the streets (fuck niggas want?) Had his old reliable thirty-eight gun in his reach It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak He runnin' around like life's a peach, 'til one day He approached this thug that had a mean mug And it looked so familiar that he called him "Young Cuz" Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge (fuck you) Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused (hold up) There was somethin' in this man's face he knew he seen before It's like lookin' in the mirror, seein' hisself more mature And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord You know what they say about he who hesitates in war (What's that?) He who hesitates is lost He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct Six shots into his kin, out of the gun Niggas be a father, you're killin' your son Six shots into his kin out of the gun Niggas, be a father, you killin' your sons Meet the parents.. {*echoes and slows down as it fades*}

You say no like you was doin' it for eons Fuck it I just hum and let the watch give off the neons When it rains it pours, I laugh to myself when I change the score You said my sex was a lot but my brain gave you more And somethin' bout how your ex was a toy, I guess he played games It's only diamond dice here not tryin' to justify When you shut your eye you can touch the sky You in trouble ma, and you should pray about speed But if that's 'bout you, what that say about me?

GodAWFUL|Beats & Rhymes In The Key of Awful Vol. 1|Reset Button|[BRIDGE] Don't know what I'm runnin' from But I know I need to get away I don't know where I'm running to But I hope that I get there soon [Verse 1: godAWFUL] The Camry sat crooked, still pumpin 80 at a pace I let Logic pass a while back, It's like I'm lazy in this race But maybe it is my fate, wait Maybe it's the taste, wait Maybe it's the scent in the air I'm not coming back! Gorgeous girl in front of me, gorgeous girl behind me Let's define irony, neither of them want me My brain and my cell, at a stage parallel Half dead, half hopin they will make it to tell I am here, let's talk, let's exchange all our hell Let's embrace, let's take it to a place that'll melt Let's lay, let's display everything that we felt Let me know that you are gonna break this as well Third times a charm bracelet, fell from your wrist But I guess it's better than sayin' it never exist I play blind, deaf, dumb, while gettin' a grip But with what you pulled out, I should of been better equipped Now - everything spins...no headlights for miles Staring at the empty seat that you left beside me There is no better timing, I will die or move on And forgot all about you once I write a few songs But not now, I'm a man up on a mission On his breathe you can smell it's a rough transition See love can't listen, so he hums to deaf ears Of little miss "don't give a fuck"-your best years One working cd, a bunch of dead air Because the radio is starting to come in less clear So all that remains, is 'All That Remains' A ball and a chain, and a call full of thanks That's when my concentration fell from the pavement And my fate was in the place on the screen navigating Twisted metal never had me feeling so complacent [Hook] That's when I hit my reset button That's when I hit my reset button That's when I hit my reset button That's when I hit my reset button [BRIDGE] Don't know what I'm runnin' from But I know I need to get away I don't know where I'm running to But I hope that I get there soon [Verse 2: godAWFUL] And now my heart feels smaller than the box that I'm sleepin in Behind a bunch of steel more contorted then the previous And I'm scared, not by the scene of it But by the fucked up fact I'm completely at peace with this I deserved this right, I fucking asked for it I was the one so eager to fast forward And all I could think of was my last chorus And how I should of told you I loved you But I guess that I never stood a chance And never could advance, with this half crooked stance Coming back home wasn't put in the plans But neither was this bed made of wood & some clamps I found myself so open in room full of locks Feelin like a runaway train they couldn't stop And when I say I'm in a place that I have never been before Believe me it is so sayin' much more than a metaphor My shoelaces is gone, I must wreak of desperation Or they noticed how fragile and easy to break I had become Maybe they saw how I had to run Just to keep myself away from being splattered in blood So here I am counting grains in an hourglass Tryin' to answer questions I didn't know how to ask No company kept, no sound to pass Just a number in my head reminding me thatIwas bound to crash Now I'm pounding cracks Livin in the vision of astoundin' grasp Like how is that? WishIcould of been up in loungin' nap But out of track And now I ask, how proud is dad? In a footstep he left miles back Like officer lemme dial that I think I'm ready for my attack Like get me the fuck up out of her I'm bound to clear the sound of here Shouting fear, to a town of near And I doubt that I'mma put down that beer But I can dream right, and I can make strides And I can apologize once I I see that daylight So put me in front the gun for the son Cause I'm done with the runnin I'm hummin' to suttin I'll come up with dumpin' my gut in to lovin' But fuck it, I'm nothin, I'm huffin and puffin Like trouble and suffer is tough for the bluff And I'm bumpin' it up to another production I put so abundantly stuffed in the cupboard Above what is pumpin my blood to the public and I Have never seen eyes that warm Never felt a heart that cold And all I can think is I guess should of known So that's when I hit my reset button

Black Star|Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star|Respiration|[Intro] "What'd you do last night?" "We did, umm, two whole cars It was me, Dez, and Main Three, right? And on the first car in small letters it said 'All you see is…' and then you know Big, big, you know some block silver letters That said 'crime in the city', right?" "It just took up the whole car?" "Yeah, yeah, it was a whole car and shit..." ¡Escúchela! La ciudad respirando [Verse 1: Mos Def] The new moon rode high in the crown of the metropolis Shining, like, "Who on top of this?" People was tusslin', arguing and bustlin' Gangstas of Gotham hardcore hustlin' I'm wrestling with words and ideas My ears is pricked, seeking what will transmit The scribes can apply to transcript Yo, this ain't no time where the usual is suitable Tonight alive, let's describe the inscrutable The indisputable, we New York the narcotic Draped in metal and fiber optics Where mercenaries is paid to trade hot stock tips For profits, thirsty criminals take pockets Hard knuckles on the second hands of working class watches Skyscrapers is colossus, the cost of living is preposterous Stay alive, you play or die, no options No Batman and Robin Can't tell between the cops and the robbers They both partners, they all heartless with no conscience Back streets stay darkened Where unbeliever hearts stay hardened My eagle talons stay sharpened, like city lights stay throbbing You either make a way or stay sobbin' The shiny Apple is bruised but sweet And if you choose to eat, you could lose your teeth Many crews retreat, nightly news repeat Who got shot down and locked down Spotlight to savages, NASDAQ averages My narrative rose to explain this existence Amidst the harbor lights which remain in the distance [Hook] So much on my mind that I can't recline Blastin' holes in the night 'til she bled sunshine Breathe in, inhale vapors from bright stars that shine Breathe out, weed smoke retrace the skyline Heard the bass ride out like an ancient mating call I can't take it, y'all, I can feel the city breathing Chest heaving, against the flesh of the evening Sigh before we die like the last train leaving [Verse 2: Talib Kweli] Breathin' in deep city breaths, sittin' on shitty steps We stoop to new lows, Hell froze the night the city slept The Beast crept through concrete jungles Communicating with one another And ghetto birds where waters fall From the hydrants to the gutters The Beast walk the beats, but the beats we be makin' You on the wrong side of the track, looking visibly shaken Taken them plungers Plunging to death that's painted by the numbers With Krylon applied pressure; cats is playing God By having children by a lesser baby mother, but fuck it We played against each other like puppets Swearing you got pull When the only pull you got is the wool over your eyes Getting knowledge in jail like a blessing in disguise Look in the skies for God, what you see besides the smog Is broken dreams flying away on the wings of the obscene Thoughts that people put in the air Places where you could get murdered over a glare But everything is fair; it's a paradox we call reality So keepin' it real will make you casualty of abnormal normality Killers Born Naturally, like Mickey and Mallory Not knowing the ways'll get you capped, like an NBA salary Some cats be emceein' to illustrate what we be seein' Hard to be a spiritual being When shit is shaking what you believe in For trees to grow in Brooklyn, seeds need to be planted I'm asking if y'all feel me and the crowd left me stranded My blood pressure boiled and rose ‘Cause New York niggas acting spoiled at shows To the winners, the spoils go I take the L, transfer to the 2, head to the gates New York life type trife, the Roman Empire state [Hook] [Spanish speaking woman] ¡Escúchela! Respirando [Verse 3: Common] On The Amen corner I stood lookin' at my former hood Felt the spirit in the wind Knew my friend was gone for good Threw dirt on the casket, the hurt, I couldn't mask it Mixin' down emotions, struggle I hadn't mastered I choreograph seven steps to Heaven In Hell, waiting to exhale and make the bread leaven Veteran of a cold war; it's Chica-I-go for What I know or what's known So some days I take the bus home, just to touch home From the crib I spend months gone Sat by the window with a clutched dome Listening to shorties cuss long Young girls with weak minds, but they butt strong Tried to call, or at least beep the Lord But didn't have a touch-tone It's a dog-eat-dog world, you gotta mush on Some of this land I must own Outta the city, they want us gone Tearing down the 'jects creating plush homes My circumstance is between Cabrini and Love Jones Surrounded by hate, yet I love home Ask my guy how he thought travelling the world sound Found it hard to imagine he hadn't been past downtown It's deep, I heard the city breathe in its sleep Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep Deep, I heard my man breathe in his sleep Of reality I touch, but for me it's hard to keep [Hook: Mos Def and Crew]

See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows against my yesterdays In hopes that she'll be okay And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair [Hook: Chris Martin] I hear my angels sing Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up Life is but a dream and you really don't wanna leave [Verse 2] Life is but a dream to me Gun shots sing to these other guys But lullabies don't mean a thing to me I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying Every day hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace Too busy letting my voice vibrate Carving out my space in this world of fly girls Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls Benzes round corners where the sun don't shine I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind Some said: "Hov, how you get so fly?"

Had the fans Andretti, that's a monster Wish I coulda spit that on the stage at Summer Jam Can't complain though, that verse helped me scoop a couple grand Aside from the music, copped a new apartment Two bedroom joint, nothing fancy, a little carpet Marble in the kitchen, cool walk-in closet A painting here and there, something simple for an artist If you havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son Well then feel sorry for me, cause I had more than one Like E-1 and Slaughterhouse single, I lost the one Before the us and Pharoahe Monch Canada tour was done I argued with her like, "Being insecure is dumb The only thing that I could get from all these whores is cum." We did the Skype thing in my bunk on late nights Always started cool but ended in the same fight Why I ain't picking up the phone once again It only takes a second to reply to BBM Baby, I don't know what to say Maybe it was the 20 hour drive from Montreal to Thunder Bay Maybe my phone died, maybe I'm sound checkin' Maybe I'm on stage going in for the crowd, sweatin' Either way it's over, you failed to understand You were dealing with a star, not your average brother man On another note, I got to kick it with my sons Up in Dave and Buster's, winning tickets, it was fun Hit Rockaway Beach, played some frisbee in the sun At summer camp they had a Track and Field Olympics and they won I took it down to Miami on the Fourth Wobbled out a mansion, and did cameo of course Shit I brought to the telly looked like panties on a horse Freak brain, this bitch said "Nigga ram me 'til I cough." (I gotta call that bitch) But yeah, Flex see that I'm focused Droppin bombs like I did to get rid of the roaches Feels good being Puerto Rican from the projects Countries overseas having a ball like my cahones This summer I did well setting up of Oh Eleven Coming up on the year my granny said "Hello" to Heaven My mom still goes through it, every now and then she cries I'm trying to bring a different set of tears into her eyes Free Agent is fire, the world's will sees it's tough Gonna drop the Yaowa Mixtape with Green to heat it up Shouts to ICU, the documentary is nuts Some people on there gone, a lot of memories, but yup Gotta keep it pushing, though the ride gets bumpy I'mma keep whipping it 'til I get money Hate to be so blunt, but I came up extra poor Borrowed from next door, couldn't get ketchup from the store The butt of all the jokes, cause of the rejects that I wore Matching perfectly with all the V-necks that I tore But nope, not no more, my feet keep the sickest kicks Still doing V-necks, but now my shit is crisp I'm coming for the title boys, I hope you niggas rhyme Treating this like high school, "A" game every time Let you niggas party, go on Vacay, I'mma grind 'Til every verse I kick is like Pele in his prime Y'all don't want a war, screaming "Mayday" with a nine Your thought caliber is no match for this AK in my mind Don't get clapped, like sex with a dirty slut When I'm done with rap, they gon' hang ya boy jersey up Cause I done been an all star on all bars My dad left and the apple never falls far So I'm gone like a sports car Anyone who thinks they're better is just wild, draw four cards I did this by myself, no help brother No more sag, I'm coming for that belt fuckers Said my prayers and God called Joell's number So stay tuned in the Fall Farewell Summer

(Can you feel? Turbulence.) [Verse One] Skull and crossbones and death bandannas A liquor store on every corner in Atlanta Cops ridin' around tossin' niggas in the slammer Tell me what's wrong I could really use some answers Now-a-days everybody wants to be a rapper About two years ago everybody was a trapper Obviously, money is what everybody's after Cause slavery ain't change It's a modern day disaster Now these are my words from me to you Everything you do from your shades to your shoes From your chains to your coupe Came from the tube Trust me I would know I was raised on it too Okay, now just let me get your attention I'ma turn the tables so you don't get defensive I'mma put my bullshit aside for a second Cause I can't be fake Cause God won't let me I used to wear a grill Because it was the trend Not because I liked it I just wanted to fit in Then I got "Eastside" tatted on my skin And I tried to get dreads but my head was too big But I was lost I ain't know who I was What else was there to do besides look like a thug So in my senior year at Columbia High I dropped out of high school and I got signed B-dot-O-dot-B was the name I ain't like Bobby Ray cause I was ashamed But you can call me Bobby Ray from this day forth And I could give a damn about the fame and fortune Honestly I don't even listen to rap Cause when I turn the radio on, out comes crap And if you make good music that's okay But on the radio, that they don't play It's easy to see we created a beast Cause everybody wants to hear what they don't need And now all the rappers got to struggle to give you That bullshit music so they can continue To live The position that I'm in Is quite an interesting predicament I will admit But you can count on me cause I'm refusing to give in Cause I'mma give you music cause we need it to exist Bitch So I'mma play my guitar Rap about aliens and sing about stars Till you understand that's what we are So we ain't got to struggle no more so we don't starve I swear to God I love you with every bar We all got problems that need to be solved So while I got the mic I'mma speak my thoughts And I'mma keep it real till the day I fall

Blu|(So)ul Amazing|Fly (Song OF Liberation)|Ready Ex? [Verse 1] She said she was sick of the city life A sweet girl but the world made her the shitty type When she was young she just wanted to be pretty like A model or an actress but, she had to work for her two kids Father in jail serving time for two bids Kids hungry asking mama where the food is And she can see their hearts beating through their two ribs Now she crying watching cribs Cause the rent's due soon, in the one bedroom And the kids kicking mama like I need some leg room Daddy gone, the babies might as well be test tubes In the projects stuck, wishing they could just move To the country, I see her time to time, trying to make a little money That makes me realize, shit, my life ain't that crummy So one day I asked her how she deals with it She said she she doesn't, she lets God, so she can fly [Hook] Fly, reach high and go Wish on to a star And release your soul Cause you know you can fly (Fly through the friendly skies) Reach high and go (Get you ticket, pack your shit, and let's roll) Wish on a star (And don't worry I'll catch you if you fall) Release your soul Cause you know you can fly [Verse 2] He said he had a problem with commitment And it was probably cause his pops was into pimping As a kid he called different women Momma So he grew up with some drama That he could never get out of, he was 18 Already hating life, so he blazed trees And he could ball but he ditched everyday it seems And his grades was so bad, he never made the team So he started slanging trees, then he moved to coke College coaches always noticed that the kid was dope But he smoked too much Dropped out of school, cause shit he didn't go too much Till one day he overdosed, sniffing coke and such I think about him time to time, and I realize how similar our past is But how different my path is One day I asked his dad how he deals with it He said he doesn't, he gets high, so he can fly [Hook] [Verse 3] He told me he was pressured and was stressing out And he usually makes music just to let it out He asked his mom about it and she told him pray to God She didn't notice that the faith was fading from his mind He tries to ignore the stress that he endures Try to find some liberation but the pains is indoors He's feelin sore since the bills start coming His stomach started rumbling, Pops calls it growing pains Ask his friends about it but, they don't know the pain They just tell him roll a blunt, try to smoke some hay So he gets high hoping it will go away But it doesn't, shit is stuck is his head Goes to sleep and the grief crawls up in his bed Start tripping out thinking he should fuck with some meds And he remembered what his grandpa said when he was young So he looked to the sky, asking God how come? I feel this pain time to time when I look in the mirror And I realize, that guy's me trying to see clearer So tell God I hear Him, and I know how to deal with it Close my eyes till I find my spirit and just fly [Hook]

Eminem|Encore|Mockingbird|[Intro] Yeah, I know sometimes Things may not always make sense to you right now But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier! Stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me [Verse 1] Hailie, I know you miss your mom And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad Even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry ‘Cause you're scared, I ain't there Daddy's with you in your prayers No more crying, wipe them tears Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls, when it whirls, when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Looking puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move Momma's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see But you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have got so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we was teenagers But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something we have no control over And that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream [Hook] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now And we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright [Verse 2] Heh, it's funny I remember back one year when Daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck 'em under the tree And said some of 'em were from me ‘Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin' ‘Cause Daddy felt like a bum, see, Daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block And your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars 'Til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart Mom and Dad was arguing a lot, so Momma moved back On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Momma out to see me But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me Then you started seeing Daddy on the TV And Momma didn't like it And you and Lainie were too young to understand it Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand ‘Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house Just reminiscing, looking at your baby pictures It just trips me out to see how much you both have grown It's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here Lainie, I'm talking to you too, Daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it? Sssshhh! Momma's only gone for the moment [Hook] Now hush, little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know Mommy's not here right now And we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright [Outro] And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'ma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat; don't fuck with Dad!

Wale|More About Nothing|The Problem|[Wale] (Spoken Word) This isn't no griot but a mere portion of a semi-important life Far from a complaint, but a mere look at the present showing you the changes that I made The proverbial lemonade that I made I made my mistakes, you see life's lemons often times come in a abundance In conjunction with the pressure that we're under Underrated some would say Hated, and some say it's the things I say or how I say em And I admit, in this race I tend to struggle to relate in words It's like I'm an alien who alienates by the herd, so as far as being heard I guess I gotta wait, deprived by the station's eye Wale, more times than not, am not for whom the air waves Thank God for the free thinkers, for you keep me in mind In this state of mind that I'm in, for you keep me in the race with the baton that y'all give And they hypebeasts, street wear, Versace and Vuitton that I'm in And really don't matter unless y'all coming with No days off, may we rip the face of the whole game off Imma say it to y'all, I'm gonna put my faith in y'all when I don't understand me They say I'm running hip-hop but I'd rather unify with y'all then stampede And lastly for everybody who doubted I can't live without you, please Continue to inspire the fire that is my re-dedication to greatness y'all Paint A Picture to A.D. to freestyles to famous songs we out 'chere (here) Unforgettable gestures, unmeasurable effort, to pleasure the masses with impeccable work ethic Let's get it, I go hard, no days off [Verse 1: Part 1] Pain on my face, laying back rolling a J Feeling like these rap niggas ain't as real as they say That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch Ain't nothing stopping us, tell u what the problem is I'm on top of my game but these niggas won't acknowledge it So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus So, to stop us better take it in blood like a phlebotomist [Seinfeld Skit] You really need some help But a regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you, you know what I mean? You need to get involved at the university level, like where Freud studied And have all those people looking at you and checking up on you That's the kind of help you need, not the once-a-week for eighty bucks, no You need a team, a team of psychiatrists working around the clock You need to go to, like, Vienna or something [Verse 1: Part 1] [Verse 1: Part 2] I walk around understanding the politics Wish you niggas father understood where the condom was '06 came, had all kind of buzz And Isaiah say one day your time will come Then '09 came, them bad record sales The silver-lining couldn't find 'em up on any shelf I'm in the mirror like "this a product of my skills?" And I feared that my fans say I failed It's just my fate, let me chill, nah flip My shit was submarine like, under ship Look at what I'm up against, scrutiny, criticism Everybody judging off a single I ain't even pick Now my eyes Chinese, keep the loud lit Now I'm taking these pills and I ain't even sick Ice and Rain, Letter, Center of Attention I wanted them on my debut, but they ain't wanna listen You know I love my team, but they couldn't see my vision Interscope is my fam, so I ain't tryna make no issue I'm just trying to paint that picture, when I'm rhyming up in this booth I'ma try to rhyme and get through, I'm documenting the truth Men lie. Women lie. Numbers won't forsaken The only album flop is the album niggas hate so A.D. 2, on the way, let's do this And God willin' niggas gonna triple up them units Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin' If no one's there to listen guess I'll put it in the music Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin' I'm heading to Vienna since y'all niggas ain't doin' shit!
