Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life So now I'm down for whatever ain't nothing nice Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly But now this higher learning got the Remy in me Liquor's invaded my kidneys Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me I can't be held accountable, D'evils beating me down, boo Got me running with guys making G's, telling lies that sound true Come test me, I never cower For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils [Hook]

Jay Z|The Black Album|December 4th|[Produced by Just Blaze] [Intro: Gloria Carter] Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child [Verse 1: Jay Z] They say "They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone" So on that note, I'm leaving after the song So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnes Reeves Who made love under the sycamore tree Which makes me a more sicker MC And my momma would claim At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain Although through the years I gave her her fair share I gave her her first real scare I made up for birth when I got here She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care But I feel worthless ‘cause my shirts wasn't matching my gear Now I'm just scratching the surface ‘Cause what's buried under there Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted But I had demons deep inside That would raise when confronted [Interlude: Gloria Carter] Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up [Verse 2: Jay Z] Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me And my momma couldn't beat me Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me So, with that disdain in my membrane Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came Then DeHaven introduced me to the game Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine; I'm a hustler now My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd And all the wavy light-skinned girls is loving me now My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had Supposedly, knowing nobody paid Jaz wack ass I'm getting ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap But that came second to me movin' this crack "Gimme a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career Till '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye! [Interlude: Gloria Carter] Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble [Verse 3: Jay Z] Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush Your blood boils you in the spot, knowing cops could rush And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch No two days are alike Except the first and fifteenth, pretty much And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up And the drought will define a man when the well dries up You learn the worth of water without work You thirst 'til you die, yup! And niggas get tied up for product And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up To show mothers they really got 'em And this was the stress I lived with 'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven For every bad decision I made, every sister I played ‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me [Outro: Jay Z] If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black

"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!" I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off [Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh?

[Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady [Verse 3] Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (GET 'EM!) Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate! I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive Am I coming or going? I can barely decide I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? All my life I was very deprived I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits! I lay awake and strap myself in the bed Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had [Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Jay Z|The Blueprint|Renegade|[Verse 1: Jay Z] Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it? See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doin' What I do, through and through, and I give you the news with a twist It's just his ghetto point of view The renegade, you been afraid, I penetrate pop culture Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters From botched robberies, niggas crouched over Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over Knocked down by some clown When child support knocked; no, he's not around Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down I bring it through the ghetto without riding round Hiding down, ducking strays From frustrated youths stuck in they ways Just read a magazine that fucked up my day How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it? I help them see they way through it – not you Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes Bet everything you're worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt [Verse 2: Eminem] Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute ‘Cause, see, they call me a menace And if the shoe fits I'll wear it But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it Now, who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics? Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits? But there's a huge interference They're saying you shouldn't hear it Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish But I'm debated, disputed, hated And viewed in America as a motherfuckin' drug addict Like you didn't experiment, nah nah That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents You fucking do-gooders Too bad you couldn't do good at marriage And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here? I don't think you do So stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo ‘Cause here we go, he's {?*Jigga j-Jigga*}?

Never been afraid to holler About anything, anything, anything, anything! [Verse 3: Jay Z] I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in By the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver Durag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty An orphan my pops left me And often, my mamma wasn't home Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown Especially on nights I brought something home To quiet the stomach rumblings My demeanor, 30 years my senior My childhood didn't mean much, only raising green up Raising my fingers to critics Raising my head to the sky, B.I.G. I did it, multi before I die No lie, just know I chose my own fate I drove by the fork in the road and went straight [Verse 4: Eminem] See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape? Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today See, it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter making this butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'… [Hook: Eminem + Jay Z] Renegade!

Eminem|Encore|Yellow Brick Road|[Intro] "What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children." "We seem to be approaching an age of the gross." {burp} "We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' nation and each generation should do a little bit better." [Verse 1] Alright, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough Let's get it started Let's start addressing this issue and open it up Let's take this shit back to the basement And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love The music that we all enjoy The music you accuse me of trying to destroy Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy On the east side of Detroit Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory I'd like to share a story This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me You have well-informed me I am well aware that I don't belong here You've made that perfectly clear I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there From the black side all the way to the white side Okay, there's a bright side: a day that I might slide You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks Them good old notorious so well-known tracks [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home [Verse 2] I'd roam the streets so much they call me a drifter Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke And steal a goddamn bike from somebody's backyard And drop it off at the park, that was the halfway mark To meet Kim, had to walk Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my Mom's That's about the time I first met Proof With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osbourne Handing out some flyers He was doing some talent shows at Center Line High I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime He looked at me like I'm out my mind Shook his head, like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme." I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place" And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit With compound syllables sound combined From that day we was down to ride Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home [Verse 3] My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through And said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew Must've been true because, man, we done banned they shoes I had the new ones, the Cool J, Ice Lamb, suede too But we just threw them in the trash, like they yesterday's news Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted, Professor X (vanglorious) Exists in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies! Now with this being a new trend, we don't fit in Crackas is out with Cactus albums, blackness is in African symbols and medallions Represent Black Power, and we ain't know what it meant Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall With 'em all over our necks like we're showin 'em off Not knowing at all, we was being laughed at "You ain't even half black! You ain't supposed to have that, homie, let me grab that! And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!" All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement Saying how we hate this How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is Which reminds me, back in '89, me and Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryna two-time me And there was this black girl at our school Who thought I was cool ‘cause I rapped So she was kinda eyeing me And oh the irony, guess what her name was? Ain't even goin' say it, plus, the same color hair as hers Was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her But she dumped me for this black guy And that's the last I ever seen or heard Or spoke to the "Oh Foolish Pride" girl But I've heard people say they heard the tape And it ain't that bad – but it was, I singled out a whole race And for that I apologize, I was wrong ‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a ho [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home

Sending the troops in the war so I turn it To today's evening news And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow) As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow) As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow) This is your evening news [Verse 2] I know you take offense to certain words I've heard worse, but I wouldn't blame ya' They say he's a entertainer, don't worry about it, never mind Kramer The Crocodile Hunter got stung, and the lion turned on the lion tamer We keep sending troops to Iraq, I figured that we must like danger Little kids don't learn in school they go to school to go spray a gun If you a parent, then be a parent, get off the couch and go raise your son Kobe just broke another record, today's game he hit 81 Now they saying he's number 1, but yesterday they all hated him OJ was named innocent, he got no sentence, he's still alive It's very ironic that the lawyer that defended him had to die Well, now my cue card says the price of gas isn't really high But I'm not going to read that, cause we all know that that's a lie [Hook] [Verse 3] We still haven't found Pac's killer, still haven't found Biggie's either 30 minutes into the case they got tired and took a breather Snoop Dogg just got arrested, everyday he gets a new subpoena Innocent when murder was the case so the prosecution got a middle finger Hip-Hop is sweeping the nation, but the contents seem so degrading Most rappers got new albums that white kids are anticipating If you don't like it on the radio or the television then switch the station Flavor Flav get a lot of ratings, Bill O'Reilly somewhere is hating Kanye just said WHAT? the president ain't got time for that The White House is going to stay white even tho' we know Obama's black 9/11 was a calculation, and some would say it was a timed attack He gave a speech on CNN, "They bombed us, now we're bombing back" Where the heck is Osama at? And I would love to talk about Katrina But every time I talk about Katrina they look at me like its a misdemeanor Anyways there’s way more important stuff that we can discuss Nsync, Making the Band, and Milli Vanilli have broken up [Hook]

If the shit is lies, god strike me and I got a question Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice [Hook] Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own (So where you from?)

It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back ‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Coming back after all these years "Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat!" That's the way it is [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah (You're my brother, you're my sister) That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah [Outro: 2Pac] Some things'll never change

Bob Dylan|Bringing It All Back Home|Subterranean Homesick Blues|[Verse 1] Johnny's in the basement, mixing up the medicine I'm on the pavement, thinking about the government The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off Look out kid, it's something you did God knows when, but you're doing it again You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend The man in the coon-skin cap in the pig pen Wants 11 dollar bills - you only got 10 [Verse 2] Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot Talking that the heat put plants in the bet book Phone's tapped anyway Maggie says "The Man, he say" They must bust in early May, "Orders from the D.A."

Ice Cube|The Predator|It Was a Good Day|[Produced by DJ Pooh] [Verse 1] Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God I don't know, but today seems kinda odd No barking from the dog, no smog And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog I got my grub on, but didn't pig out Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out Hooked it up for later as I hit the door Thinking, "Will I live another 24?" I gotta go, ‘cause I got me a drop-top And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop Had to stop at a red light Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight And everything is alright I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all "Which park are y'all playing basketball?" Get me on the court and I'm trouble Last week, fucked around and got a triple double Freaking niggas every way, like MJ I can't believe today was a good day [Verse 2] Drove to the pad and hit the showers Didn't even get no static from the cowards ‘Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me Saw the police and they rolled right past me No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction As I ran the intersection Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching Yo! MTV Raps What's the haps on the craps? Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em Roll 'em in a circle of niggas And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11 7, even back door Lil Joe I picked up the cash flow Then we played bones, and I'm yelling, "Domino!" Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A Today was a good day [Verse 3] Left my nigga's house paid Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big fat fanny Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani And my dick runs deep, so deep So deep put her ass to sleep Woke her up around one She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin' Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion I was glad everything had worked out Dropped her ass off and then chirped out Today was like one of those fly dreams Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams No helicopter looking for a murder 2 in the morning, got the Fatburger Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp" Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up Half way home and my pager still blowin' up Today I didn't even have to use my AK I got to say it was a good day [Outro] Hey, wait, wait a minute!

But he wasn't talking about coke and birds It was more like spoken word Except he's really putting it down? And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory And what we need to do in the game Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed If you could feel how my face felt You would know how Mase felt Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe My dawgs couldn't tell if I... I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky It was televised There's been an accident like GEICO They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass? Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire [Hook/Outro] Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)

Through the fire ("It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!") Through whatever, come what may For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man) I'd take it all the way Right down to the wire Even through the fire To the limit Through the fire To the limit Through the fire To the limit Through the fire To the limit

Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say? [Verse 1: Ice Cube] Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown And not the other color, so police think They have the authority to kill a minority Fuck that shit, ‘cause I ain't the one For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun To be beating on, and thrown in jail We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager With a little bit of gold and a pager Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics You'd rather see me in the pen Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o Beat a police out of shape And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape To tape off the scene of the slaughter Still getting swoll off bread and water I don't know if they fags or what Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none But don't let it be a black and a white one ‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top Black police showing out for the white cop Ice Cube will swarm On any motherfucker in a blue uniform Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT Punk police are afraid of me Huh, a young nigga on the warpath And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath Of cops, dying in L.A Yo, Dre, I got something to say [Hook] Fuck tha police!

MC Ren, will you please give your testimony To the jury about this fucked up incident? [Verse 2: MC Ren] Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority Because the niggas on the street is a majority A gang is with whoever I'm steppin' And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in A stash box, for the so-called law Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw Lights start flashing behind me But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me But that shit don't work, I just laugh Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you, punk!" Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk Pulling out a silly club, so you stand With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand But take off the gun so you can see what's up And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up! Make you think I'ma kick your ass But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime But I'ma smoke them now and not next time Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me Or any asshole that threatens me I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me The motherfuckin' villain that's mad With potential to get bad as fuck So I'ma turn it around Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (Gunshot sounds) Yeah, somethin' like that But it all depends on the size of the gat Taking out a police would make my day But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say… [Hook] Fuck tha police!

Just shut the fuck up And get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!) But I didn't do shit Man, just shut the fuck up! Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit? [Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren] I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin' Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and Shining the light in my face, and for what? Maybe it's because I kick so much butt I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger Of an Uzi or an AK ‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say They put out my picture with silence ‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence The E with the criminal behavior Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor Without a gun and a badge, what do you got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot By me, or another nigga And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger (Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!) And as you all know, E's here to rule Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a Dumb motherfucker with a gun And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one That I take out, and then get away While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say [Hook] Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! [Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop The verdict: The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck White bread, chickenshit motherfucker Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie! Get him out of here! I want justice! Get him the fuck out my face! I want justice! Out, right now! Fuck you, you black motherfuckers! [Hook] Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!

Jay Z|Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life|A Week Ago|[Intro: Jay Z] It was all good just a week ago Had this all good just a week ago [Interlude: Too $hort] Last week I had everything. I had the money, had the cars, the bitches, and the jewelry. And then my motherfucking nigga started snitching. Beyotch! [Verse 1: Jay Z] Growing up in the hood, just my dog and me We used to hustle in the hood for all to see Problems; I called on him, he called on me We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P Let him unlock doors off my keys Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly The feds came to get me, we both fled quickly Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change And when he called collect and I heard his name I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone He's talking reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone I said: "Damn, dog! What, 9 weeks and you're home?" He said: "Main man, you think shit's sweet ‘Cause you're home." I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone The crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin' I said: "The world don't stop, I've got to keep-keep on." From there I sensed the beef was on I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced And they show the other side When they catch a new case; it's on [Hook: Too $hort + Jay Z] It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks I don't see how this side of you could be provoked Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what seven days can change A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names It was all good just a week ago [Verse 2: Jay Z] Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell We both came in this game, blind as hell I did a little better, had more clientele Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill' I could bail out and blow trial and come around on appeal Had niggas thinking I was from uptown for real I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30 Freezing on them corners, still holding my crack Looking up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?? Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack You tell them feds I said: "I'm never going back." I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious [Hook: Too $hort + Jay Z] It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks I don't see how this side of you could be provoked Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what seven days can change A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names It was all good just a week ago [Verse 3: Jay Z] The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things All this after a week in the bing I'm mad at myself, ‘cause I didn't spot the weakling I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that? Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry That's right, the same game That make you math could make you die It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat? Now, you know that's bad when your sister is mad And your son gotta grow up, like, "This is my dad?" The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars [Hook: Too $hort + Jay Z] It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks I don't see how this side of you could be provoked Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what seven days can change A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names It was all good just a week ago [Outro: Too Short] Shit is crazy, man. All these niggas out here snitchin'. We was one step away from taking this crack money, and recycling it through the ghettoes, and building back up our own hoods. Now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other. I got partners doing 15–20. Wouldn't have been doing SHIT if you didn't snitch. Beyotch! It's about time y'all check that shit out, man. It ain't all good, shut your mouth, just watch the game, and don't snitch. It sure will do a lot for you. Believe that, baby. Jay Z, Short Dawg's in the house, mane. You know I got it, got it going on. We got the money. Ain't got nothing to do with crime, baby. But I'm recognizing… [Interlude: Jay Z] You rat bastard!

The Roots|Game Theory|Don't Feel Right|[Hook - Maimouna Youssef] It don't feel right, it don't feel right Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more Things don't feel right over here Lately I ain't been seeing it clear Seems to me nowadays things have changed I don't know if I feel the same [Verse 1-Black Thought] Yo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double The struggle ain't right up in ya face, it's more subtle But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit Where the dope slangin' keep swangin' like Sonny Liston The money missing and there's mouths to feed Get the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid? When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air Was it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear? Something don't feel right out here [Hook] [Verse 2] Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a watchman And when I'm writing my thoughts out, really I'm boxing My main adversary any silly concoction Freeze your face like botulinum toxin If you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton The Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense I'm overseeing anything within my circumference This ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses I stand where the people got the heat in they pockets You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit If you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted If it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'? [Hook] [Verse 3] Yo, children working, weapon producing Natural disaster got the planet in a panic We all got to make that living Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion Forms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering Who never had shit and ain't got nothing But more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin' Hot zone for a piece of the cake back I can't work for it, I can certainly take that I'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black Ill, but that's too real for TV It's crazy when you too real to be free If you don't got no paper, then steal this CD Listen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me [Hook]

2Pac|Until the End of Time|Letter To My Unborn Child|[Intro] To my unborn child… To my unborn child In case I don’t make it Just remember, Daddy loves you [Verse 1] Now ever since my birth I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile In case I never get to holla at my unborn child Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin' Trying to earn every penny that I'm gettin', I'm reminiscin' To the beginning of my mission When I was conceived and came to be in this position My momma was a Panther: loud single parent, but she proud When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house ‘Cause my mama say I'm good for nothing, so I'm out Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again My only friend is my misery Wanting revenge for the agony they did to me See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure getting better Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child [Hook: Natasha Walker] I'm writing you a letter This is to my unborn child Want to let you know I love you If you didn't know I feel this way ‘Cause I think about you every day I have so much to say [Verse 2] Seems so complicated to escape fate And you can never understand till we trade places Tell the world I feel guilty for being anxious Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist It's hard to face this cold world on a good day When will they let the little kids in the hood play? I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin' Living proof there's a God if you need a reason Can I believe in my own fate? Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way? Dear Mama, I'm a man now I wanna make it on my own, not a handout Make way for a whirlwind prophesized I wanna go in peace when I got to die On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child [Hook] [Verse 3] Dear Lord, can you hear me? Tell me what to say To my unborn seed in case I pass away Will my child get to feel love? Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs? ‘Cause being black hurts, and even worse if you speak first Living my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse? ‘Cause maybe if I tried to change Who'm I kidding? I'm a thug til I die; I'm a rider, mane Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places Regular criminal oasis awaits us If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there And I'm sorry for not being there Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World Bless the boys and all my little girls To the Lord: I'm eternal, resting in peace Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child [Outro] Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child To my unborn child… This letter goes out to my seeds that I might not get to see ‘cause of this lifestyle Just know your daddy loved you Got nothing but love for you And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had ‘Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind When you get to be my age, you’ll understand Just know I got love for you And I’ll see you if there’s a ghetto in Heaven If there’s a ghetto Heaven, I’ll be there waiting for you Heh heh, take care. Run wild, but be smart Follow the rules of the game I know sometimes there’s confusion Rules of the game is gonna get you through it All day every day Watch out for these snakes and fakes Friends come a dime a dozen Be an individual, work hard Study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody

Boots] City lights from far away can make you drop your jaw Sparklin' like sequins on a transvestite at Mardi Gras There's beauty in the cracks of the cement When I was five I hopped over them wherever we went to prevent Whatever it was that could break my momma's back Little did I know that it would roll up in a Cadillac And matter-of-fact, she couldn't see him like a cataract And on the track, she went from beautiful to battle axe And back at home, she would cry into her pillow Vomit in the commode, I was six years old I would crawl onto her lap and we would hug and hold Never knew how she was sufferin' for my food and clothes She asked me what I thought of Jesus when he broke off some bread I said, "He's missin' an arm, and he seems like a pee-pee head" She said, don't cuss, and my teeth to go brush And get ready for bed, and the toilet to flush With tears in my momma's eyes, I was her everything Before she went out on the stroll She'd tuck me into bed and sing "You're just too beautiful for words" I see the red and white lights as the ambulance flies Reminds me of midnight in a dope fiend's eyes And my nine-year-old self as paramedics leave Left to bawl my eyes out on a neighbor's sleeve To give illustrations that are clear and clean I'll take you two hours back, before this scene Early in the morning when the sun starts to creep When the birds start to chirp and crackheads go to sleep Moms was comin' in I heard her keys go clink Wearin' nothin' but pumps, bikini, and fake mink Even though she served, for fifty dollars-a-pop Hardly had enough for rent after Jesus re-copped That day the landlady got her rent before he got his knot Slammed momma's head against the front bolt lock Then the pump with one arm done harm Reached back and plowed into her head like a farm Never saw the act, locked in the back, I was cussin' Heard the blap blap of twenty head crack percussion And body blows, her body froze from bolos to the spine I was hysterically cryin', all she could do was whine She didn't even have the strength to say, I love you Boo But I said it to her and she knew that I knew She was dead by the time the ambulance got on the case But I never will forget the plastic hand stuck in her face Stop at the intersection to ask Jesus 'bout directions Let's go to Frisco, I got very friendly vocal inflections Mob a left at MacArthur to continue in flight Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night [Hook] [Verse 3 - Boots] The rain dropped giant pearls, God was pissin' on the world Or that old man who was snorin' rolled on over and earled My temperature gauge read, cold and blistery Spinnin' wheels made each piece of asphalt history This was Jesus debut out the penitentiary Fifteen years, but it seem like a century See, he went in the pen for some other murder drama Twelve years old when I wrote him quote I wanna be a pimp, comma You accidentally killed my mom, no player hatin' points You know how bitches act, shit, exclamation points First it was a set up move, then it was the truth His letters were the only thing I had as a youth But his lopsided game, see, was really counterfeit So my little son Dominic thinks that I'm a dick Cause I was runnin' 'round like a little baby Jesus To me women had to be saints, hoes, or skeezers And I don't think that it's gonna end til we make revolution But who gonna make the shit if we worship prostitution Ain't no women finna die for the same old conclusion Put they life on the line so some other pimp could use 'em Pulled into a vacant lot, the road to recovery Pulled out my pistol as we brushed against the shrubbery Jesus said, why the hell you pointin' a gat So I pulled a piece of game I could use out the hat I said, "This trip is over, we ain't finna ride on This is for my mental and my momma that I cried on Microsoft motherfuckers let bygones be bygones But since I'm Macintosh, I'mma double click your icons" He struggled for life, then gave up the fight Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night [Hook] [Boots] And I still remember momma You're much too beautiful for words

2Pac|Tupac: Resurrection OST|Runnin' (Dying to Live)|[Intro: 2Pac and (?)] Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying? I was like, this is like a fucking election It is that (You know what I am saying) Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like… [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? (You don't know) Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die? [Verse 1 - The Notorious B.I.G.] Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up Choppin' rocks overnight. The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White We had to grow dreads to change our description Two cops is on the milk box missin' Show they toes, you know they got stepped on A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon Runnin' from the police, picture that Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack That's why I bust back, it don't phase me When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?

[Verse 2 - 2Pac] (It's on me), but still I'm having memories Of high speed when the cops crashed As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts? Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes No hesitation in extermination of these snitches Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna to screw me Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do? But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew And now media is trying to test me Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me Misery is all I see, that's my mind state My history with the police will shake the crime rate My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped He screamed "Thug Life!" and emptied the clip Got tired of runnin' from the police [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die? [Outro - 2Pac] They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast [The Notorious B.I.G.] I was more shocked than anything, you know what I'm saying? But I wasn't more shocked of him dying I was more shocked of him... Pac is a strong dude, yo I know dude, you know what I'm saying? Real strong So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, "Again?" you know what I'm sayin'? He always getting shot, or shot at He going to pull through this one again Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over You know what I'm saying? But when he, when he died I was just like, "whoa", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by I mean even though we was going through our drama I would never wish death on nobody, you know what I'm sayin' Because there ain't no coming back from that

You must be kidding You got to change the whole box spring, I ain't bullshitting You get hit with hysteria Cause I'm a bury a big one inside your private area All hell is in your tush When Kool G.

"Rated XXX" [Verse 2] Some say that I'm nasty plus Hookers are mad because they can't outlast me Girl, you ain't too small Cause I turn your grip to one size fits all So if you're still confused when I'm screwing Let me explain to you exactly what I'm doing Exploring your body like a biologist Inventing new ways just like a scientist Tagging my name on your buns just like a printist While I'm hurting your ass just like a dentist You're so wild, I feel like I'm a zoologist Stretching your shit more than a gynecologist I'm a twist your ass to death, miss And when you piss, you'll see more stars than an astrologist G Rap is hot-blooded, freaking horny Far from corny, come and jump on me I'm not small at all, I won't break down or stall I drive your ass up the wall Nuts and everything are well in shape Only thing missin' on my dick is a cape Let's get together, honey, you never know what's next And I'm a talk like sex Rated XXX [Chorus] "Can't ya diggit, Honey?" "Rated XXX" [Verse 3] Big girls try to squash me But I think with my dick, honey, so come and brainwash me Hit the sack cause I ain't joking Cause when I start pumping shit up, I leave it smoking So you better hold on tight all right Cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite I stick a chick and it kills her I'm probably related to Long Dong Silver But it gets gooder and gooder Every time I grab a hooker and I put her on my frankfurter Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip Cause the only thing I'm licking is your ass with a whip And it's a real freaky scene I'm hitting girls with their heads in a guillotine Why, certainly I'm squirting I bust a nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain Pushing your head to the pillow And giving more pleasure than a double-headed dildo A big ass gets me hardened But I fuck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweety I'll fuck you on the "A" train while I write graffiti In a restaurant, taking you straight to heaven In a cab or the back of 7-11 Whether you're white and the music you like is rock You can come and get some hip-hop cock Consider this dick on your clitoris but never try to flex Cause I'mma talk like sex [Outro] "Talks like sex"

Can I have your attention, Mn-hmm There's just a few things that I've got to mention (Uh-huh) There's girlies out here that seem appealing But they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings I'm telling you As Rick is my name I wouldn't trust no girl unless she feels the same Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?) Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop Cause all they do is they hurt and trample Listen up close, here comes my first example Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while Plans for the future, she's having your child Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts Telling all your friends about your family thoughts One friend was drunk so he starts to act wild He tells the truth about the kid It's not your child Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk He said, "Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work" And she led him on and tried to please him She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?) Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop Cause all they do is they hurt and trample Listen up close, here comes my second example It's your wife You buy the tramp jewels and clothes You get sentimental and bring home a rose Give her everything cause you swear she's worth it All your friends tell you, "The bitch don't deserve it" Love is blind, so there goes your wealth Until one day, you see things for yourself Came home from work early, Mr. Loverman You had a card and some candy in your right hand There's the mailman, he was short yet stout He went inside your house and didn't come back out Bust it Just a friendly stop, come on, is it? The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit? The thought alone makes your temperature boil You say to yourself, she might still be loyal You open up your door and stand in a trance You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants Came home to party At work had a hard day Look around your house and you say, "Where the hell are they?" Run upstairs up to your bedroom You look inside your room, you see something brewin' Cover your mouth because you almost choke You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat Treat 'em like a prostitute (Mm-hmm) Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop Cause all they do is they hurt and trample Listen up close, here comes my last example Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot And today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot As you open up the door she says, "Get on the floor" She wants to try things she's never tried before She takes off your drawers and works you over She calls you Twinkles And you call her Rover Next thing you know, the ho starts to ill She says, "I love you, Harold" and your name is Will That's not the half 'til you start to ride her Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her It's not yours-who can it be? I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky Treat 'em like a prostitute Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well Treat no girlie well, until you're sure of the scoop

Eminem|The Eminem Show|'Till I Collapse|[Intro: Eminem] ‘Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up But you gotta search within you And gotta find that inner strength And just pull that shit out of you And get that motivation to not give up And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse [Verse 1: Eminem] Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em ‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em? Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up? Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse [Verse 2: Eminem] Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walk around Like nothing's bothering me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse [Verse 3: Eminem] Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first ‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em The track is on some battling raps, who want some static? ‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse [Outro: Eminem (Nate Dogg)] Until the roof (until the roof) The roof comes off (the roof comes off) Until my legs (until my legs) Give out from (underneath me) I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me

Joe Budden|Mood Muzik 4.5: The Worst Is Yet To Come|Downfall|[Intro] Yall don't know me Honestly, I can't say that I blame yall I don't even really know myself But, yall probably shouldn't know me [Verse 1] Last thing I'm tryna be is the good guy now I ain't never gave a fuck, why should I now? Like the world's interrupting my song, with an interlude Can't y'all see I'm busy trying to balance out my chemical? Finishing up, what y'all ain't even begin to do When your back's against the ropes it's either him or you Y'all ain't so important that my words are meant for you When did ey'body become so sensual Caught up in the he-say, she-say, blog sites Him and her, broke up, WorldStar, Nahright Dumb fans, they believe, everything that y'all write Found out, friends fake, couldn't even facade right Pressures on, won't fail, nigga got too much to prove Would've been, lost it, but I got too much to lose Say what you want about Joe, but I stood my ground Bitch, I get it up myself, you just put it down They say, I put my whole life on display to my dismay Stop it, you're carrying on without logic Let me tell you this about Joe I only say what I want you to hear You'll only see what I want to show Crushing up the Percocet, chasing the high, Talli I couldn't make this shit up if I tried The forecast shows a downpour Y'all just made God cry, praying for my Downfall [Transition] This shit I'm talking 'bout right here Let me tell you niggas something You can be anything in this world that you want Except for my downfall [Verse 2] I'm a victim of society, circumstance or just feelings Was a nigga victimized? Or just willing? No blinds, no bags, just dealing No foundation or floor plan, just building Check it, nights bright, but the days dark Covered in tattoos, but hate art These eggshells I walk on are razor sharp Staring at the finish line, looking for a way to start I've been called everything, an extremist Is that a bad thing or what they really mean is Anything a nigga do, a nigga mean it And I won't let a person, place or thing come between it An opportunist is how they paint me But if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me? Still I feel like my problems are great Shit, if I don't never solve em' I'm straight On the bright side God choose me to put a lot on my plate So he had to figure I wouldn't be bothered by the weight I'm trying to change the pattern but it's on loop Even an outcast in my own group What's it mean when ey'body standing next to you expects of you Everything that comes wit a spectacle? If everywhere I go, I just leave behind residue Tell me, trust me, I won't think nothing less of you [Hook] I'm sorry I ain't around more Come up with me, or stay on the ground floor I don't need shelter from the downpour Y'all can be whatever you want, just not my downfall They tryna make me slow, tryna take me, no! Can't be my downfall They tryna knock my grind, I won't stop, I'm fine Can't be my downfall [Verse 3] No moment of clarity The next fight showing is a rarity Severity in me against my growin popularity Rappers won't rap, I'm forced to believe they scared of me But can no longer use the scape goat, 'They not aware of me' So y'all can go and throw your little pot shots Some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot I'm getting my head right, recollecting Y'all looking for some website resurrection Being that I got too much to lose Or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that I'm accused No longer amused, affected my loved ones Now they startin' to bruise And I don't want no parts of that abuse Wouldn't wish upon my worst foe, a day in my shoes That'll just eliminate any excuse And why entertain em'? Old me would'a lost my senses, y'all just helping the new me regain em' Been punched in the face It was either feed my family or hunt wit the .38 I ain't want brunch to wait I've out grown Hip-Hop, it turned into a Day-Care So next time some shit is on my mind, it'll stay there I'm staring at the man in the mirror But it ain't helping see the man any clearer So I get M.I.A from around y'all Till God stops answering these prayers for my downfall [Hook] [Verse 4] Tell me what am I to do If I ain't have a soul a nigga always had you, pardon due But I gotta speak candidly How the FUCK could you abandon me?!? Wit 5 years of blood, sweat and tears But it was obviously a disconnect We turned that into a disrespect Said she been holding it inside for years, she's unhappy So the girl I wan' marry was afraid to come and tap me So I went away on tour, and you went on one of your own But while you was on the horn all day wit ol' boy Did you ever think about what it would do to your home? What's his name? Where's he live? What is it he offers? What's he got to give? And I love you so much that when I caught on to your fibs I hit you like a man, you wore it in your ribs I was heated But had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see what's underneath it Come to find out you felt lied to and cheated Mistreated, and kept it a big secret Or are you just loose? And I'm so naive I'm tryna give you an excuse Now that I refuse to believe, we life partners Holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us Can't use anything I ever gave you to bury me You supposed to be the one to bury me You wan' leave? Then goodbye Think the grass look greener on the other side, but it's dye [Hook]

God only knows (Stay wide awake) [Verse 2] So dark and so cold My friends don't know this other side of me There's a monster inside of me It's quite ugly And it frightens me But they can't see what I can see There's a vacancy in my tummy It's making me play hide-and-seek Like Jason, I'm so hungry She's naked, see, no privacy But I can see she wants me So patient, see, I try to be But gee, why does she taunt me? Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep And I creep right through the front, see So blatantly, but silently Cause I know that she's sound sleep "Who's waking me so violently" "And why's he on top of me?" "He's raping me" she tries to scream "Somebody please get him off me" "He's taping me, he's biting me" "He's laughing like it's funny" She's scraping me, she's fighting me She's scratching like some dumb freak Escaping me, no dice, you see I might just be Ted Bundy Or Satan, gee what a sight to see I'm dancing in my red panties I'm crazy but it's alright with me Man life can be so empty Stay away from me cause I'm dancing To quite a different drumbeat [Hook] Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't Boy you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart Come with me to another side In a world so cold and so dark A world so dark, a world so cold A world where only some will go But none return When will they learn? Where do they go? God only knows (Stay wide awake) [Verse 3] Better try to stay wide awake Or you might end up found dead by the lake Soon as you lay me down to sleep It's your soul I'mma try to take Pray for light of day right away Why do they try to fight today? I must make them pay twice as much Might as well put the knife away Now I use power tools, how 'bout now? Are you in the shower? Scour you for 6 hours 'Til outage of power outlets How did you figure out I was down in your basement now, ya Musta just heard the sound Of my stomach growling from down there Prowler, there's no one fouler Bound ya, that's how they found ya Face down in the tub I drown ya With piles of downers around ya Such nostalgia and power Such prowess, look how you cower Jump out on you now Like I was a Jawa from fucking Star Wars Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye, beddy-bye-bye It's time to die-die Ought to not even bother to scream It don't even matter Amazing when grazing skin With these razor blades he waves at ya Not your everyday Damien Bathe me in holy water Nothing like Son of Sam So please understand There's no gun in hand Where's the thrill in the hunt? There's no fun in that Here I come with axe Fun to act like lumberjack When I'm hacking 'em up with that What was that? Dial 9-1-1 Someone's coming in from the back [Hook] Soon as my flow starts I compose art like the ghost of Mozart Even though they all say that they're real I know that most aren't Boy you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart Come with me to another side In a world so cold and so dark A world so dark, a world so cold A world where only some will go But none return When will they learn?

Fooled you niggas What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin' War gets deep, some beef is everlastin' Complete with thick scars Brothers knifing each other up in prison yards Drama – where does it start? You know the block was ill as a youngster Every night it was like a cop would get killed Body found in the dumpster For real a hustler, purchased my Range Niggas throwing dirt on my name Jealous ‘cause fiends got they work and complain Bitches left me ‘cause they thought I was finished Should've knew she wasn't true She came to me when her man caught a sentence Diamonds are blinding, I never make the same mistakes Moving with a change of pace Lighter load, see now the king is straight Swelling my melon, ‘cause none of these niggas real Heard they were telling police, how can a kingpin squeal? This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found You need some soul-searching, the time is now [Hook]

Nas|I Am...|Nas Is Like|[Produced by DJ Premier] [Verse 1] Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's being born Same time a man is murdered; the beginning and end As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain My plateau, and also, what defines my name First it was Nasty, but times have changed Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane? That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough To the big dogs living large, taking in light Pushing big toys, getting nice, enjoying your life It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell - NAS, NAS [Scratched Hook] "Nas is like life or death…" "I'm a rebel…" "My poetry's deep, I never fell…" "Nas is like…" "Half man half amazing…" "No doubt…" [Verse 2] "Nas is like…" Earth, Wind & Fire, rims and tires Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas "Nas is like…" Iron Mike, messiah type Before the Christ, after the death The last one left, let my cash invest in stock Came a long way from blastin' TEC's on blocks Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough Dimes giving fellatio, siete zeros Bet my 9 spit for the pesos, but what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid Before my number's called, history's made Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die Making choices that determine my future under the sky To rob, steal or kill, I'm wondering why It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame? Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is [Scratched Hook] "Nas is like life or death…" "I'm a rebel…" "My poetry's deep, I never fell…" "Nas is like…" "Half man half amazing…" "No doubt…" [Verse 3] "Nas is like…" Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet I'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather Like Greeks in Egypt Learning something deep from they teachers I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for Always got you, I’m like Pac dude you would cry for I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money Corporate accounts from a rich company I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races Combined in one man; like the '99 Summer Jam Bulletproof Hummer man I'm like being locked down around new faces And none of 'em fam I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up Y'all know what I'm like Y'all play it your system every night, now… [Scratched Hook] "Nas is like life or death…" "I'm a rebel…" "My poetry's deep, I never fell…" "Nas is like…" "Half man half amazing…" "No doubt…"

Eminem|The Slim Shady LP|Bad Meets Evil|[Produced by Jeff Bass] [Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)] I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts You know, there's a story behind that there saloon 20 years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen Got murdered in cold-blood That old saloon there was their little "home away from home" They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern And on a quiet night, you can still hear The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9" [Verse 1: Eminem] I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph And the noise is spread Picked up and transmitted through Royce's head Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed 'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead Told him each one of his boys is dead I asked him to come to the dark side He made a choice and said... [Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"] Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which one'll swerve first Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking On speakers in the ghetto Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of an atheist Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse And stay over-worked It's like the Nazis and the Nation Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth [Hook 1: Eminem] ‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law ‘cause I don't agree with police either (Shit, me neither) [Verse 3: Eminem] We ain't eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasin' rage on anybody in squeezin' range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin' rain (He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up And I'm pissed off, ‘cause I can't find a decent vein [Verse 4: Royce da 5'9"] The disaster with dreads I'm bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead When in danger, it's funny Actually my flavor's similar to a waiter ‘Cause I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains, while slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it Murder you then come to your funeral Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whippin' human ass, throwing blows, crackin' jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass I'm blazing emcees, at the same time amazing emcees Somehow, emcees ain't that eyebrow-raising to me From all of angles of us, flash a MAC loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust 'til volcanoes erupt [Spoken: Eminem] Hello? Ayo, what’s up? We’re coming to get you! Stop! THEY KNOW IT’S US!!! [Verse 5: Eminem] I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? I'm the one who burned your house down, well, I'm out now And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms And you won't see me, like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe [Hook 2: Royce da 5'9"] ‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Against peaceful, see you in Hell for the sequel (We'll be waiting) See you in Hell Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady See you in Hell for the sequel (bye-bye) Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time) [Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)] And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid Look like law-abiding citizens It's too bad they had to go out the way they did Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon But their spirits still live on 'til this day Shhh… wait, did y'all hear that?

I can relate to kids going straight to the league When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed And that's around the time That your idols become your rivals You make friends with Mike But got to A.I. him for your survival Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous Cause we want to be them, and they want to be us So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment That you take for granted, you can thank me now And oh my goodness you're welcome, you're welcome At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them Cause they think that I can help them Get back to where they fell from But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight Except the niggas that I came with, they good for life That's how you know it's going down in case another chance never comes around [Hook] You could thank me now, go ahead Thank me later, yeah I know what I said But later doesn't always come so instead It's okay, you could thank me now [Verse 2] Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming I think I'm spending all my time with the wrong women I think I'll have a chance at love and knowing me I'll miss it Cause me dedicating my time just isn't realistic Man, the good girls went silent on me They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me But do I ever come up in discussion Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins? Do I? Or is missing what we had out of the question? I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes Who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul But those same ones from your area will grow into women That are ready to get married at hello Because of what they allowed, where are they all now? I know they're somewhere watching So I'm trying to make them proud Searching for the meaning, you'll find it next to me They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see I'm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree? They say the doors will open up Soon as you find the missing key That's probably why I'm in this bitch shining Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded And the bandwagon's full But you can try and run behind it, I'm sorry Poolside drinking, Margarita rounds Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town I'm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown And I know life is just a game In which the cards are facing down I'm in a world where things are taken, never given How long they choose to love you will never be your decision And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen So while I'm still here in this position [Hook] You could thank me now, go ahead Thank me later, yeah I know what I said But later doesn't always come so instead It's okay, you could thank me now

Eminem|The Slim Shady EP|If I Had|[Intro] "Life," by Marshall Mathers. What is life? Life is like a big obstacle Put in front of your optical to slow you down And every time you think you've gotten past it It's gonna come back around And tackle you to the damn ground What are friends? Friends are people that you think are your friends But they're really your enemies, with secret identities And disguises to hide their true colors So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers They wanna come back And cut your throat when you ain't looking What is money? Money is what makes a man act funny Money is the root of all evil Money'll make them same friends come back around Swearing that they was always down What is life? I'm tired of life [Verse 1] I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins I'm tired of committing so many sins Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins Tired of never having any ends Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins Tired of not having a deal Tired of having to deal with the bullshit Without grabbing the steel Tired of drowning in my sorrow Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas To start my Monte Carlo I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and dartin' off I'm tired of jobs startin' off at $5.50 an hour Then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk For this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk I'm tired of using plastic silverware Tired of working at Builder's Square Tired of not being a millionaire [Hook] But if I had a million dollars I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics If I had a magic wand I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on While I'm on the john If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough Because I'd still be out robbing armored trucks If I had one wish, I would ask For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss [Verse 2] I'm tired of being white trash, broke and always poor Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store I'm tired of not having a phone Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on Tired of not driving a BM Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum Tired of not being on tour Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work In the back of a Contour I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns Tired of being stared at Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat Tired of stepping in clubs, wearing the same pair of Lugz Tired of people saying they're tired Of hearing me rap about drugs Tired of other rappers who ain't bringing half the skill as me Saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me" And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs Tired of JLB saying, "where hip-hop lives" [Hook] But if I had a million dollars I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics If I had a magic wand I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on While I'm on the john If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough Because I'd still be out robbing armored trucks If I had one wish, I would ask For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss [Outro] You know what I'm saying? I'm tired of all of this bullshit telling me to be positive How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive? You know what I'm saying? I rap about shit around me, shit I see You know what I'm saying? Right now, I'm tired of everything Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm saying? But hey, it's cool though You know what I'm saying? I'm just fed up, that's my word

Mr. Lif|Emergency Rations|Home of the Brave|Now let's talk about self expression, true expression Open your minds without question No doubt, tell me what you're thinking about Let's try to set aside pride and clout Can you believe I feel the same exact way you do? You truly do believe these modern ways have fooled you Systems exist so we never meet each other Pretty soon from now they'll outlaw the word "brother" And that's true if they see you walking with a crew If you don't know, that means more than two I'll tell you what they'll do They'll pull over, hunt you over Kick your ass, nightstick to your shoulder I know it's unjust, as if it wasn't enough If you try to fight back they're locking your ass up And Chuck already told you that a cell is hell But I'm waiting for the phone so I'll sit for a spell Call the guard, tell him I'm a piece of God With no beliefs in his streets or his boulevards I eat, read so my mental is hard And the heat from my anger just melted the bars They reach for their guns so I put them to sleep Break the chains and put the shoes back on my feet He's on the loose with no discernible scars or marks Just the mind of Mandela and the heart of Rosa Parks So I dip, time to see the governor and mayor Tell them life ain't fair, see if they care Well they do, but only if they on the air So they appear to have a heart and make a flair But they haven't done shit for us and that's a fact Their only function is to keep the funny money where it's at And it causes pain, stress Ask me if we need a different way of life (yes) Headline: Bush steals the presidency He needs the backing of the media what could the remedy be? The country's headed for recession reminiscent of the Great Depression Are lives worth a world of power? Easy question Planes hit the towers and the Pentagon Killing those the government wasn't dependent on It's easy to control the scared so they keep us in fear With their favorite Middle Eastern demon named Bin Laden this year Bush disguises blood lust as patriotism Convincing the living to love "Operation Let's Get 'Em" But when he realized we don't support their attacks They needed something to distract, hmm, anthrax This further demonizes Afghanis So Americans cheer while we kill their innocent families And what better place to start a war To build a pipeline to get the oil that they had wanted before America supported the Taliban To get Russia out of Afghanistan That's how they got the arms in They're in a war against the Northern Alliance And we can't build a pipeline in hostile environments Here's what your history books won't show: You're a dead man for fucking with American dough They killed several birds with one stone While you're at home with anti-terrorism up in your dome But my eyes are wide open and my TV is off Great, cause I save on my electricity cost And you can wave that piece of shit flag if you dare But they killed us because we've been killing them for years

Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five|The Message|The Message|[Produced by Clifton "Jiggs" Chase] [Intro] It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under [Verse 1] Broken glass everywhere People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care I can't take the smell, can't take the noise Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice Rats in the front room, roaches in the back Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat I tried to get away but I couldn't get far ’Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car [Hook] Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under [Verse 2] Standing on the front stoop, hanging out the window Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow Crazy lady, living in a bag Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses Down at the peep show watching all the creeps So she can tell her stories to the girls back home She went to the city and got so so siditty She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own [Hook] Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under [Verse 3] My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight The bill collectors, they ring my phone And scare my wife when I'm not home Got a bum education, double-digit inflation Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station Neon King Kong standing on my back Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane Sometimes I think I'm going insane I swear I might hijack a plane! [Hook] Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under [Verse 4] My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school ’Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps ’Cause it's all about money; ain't a damn thing funny You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey They pushed that girl in front of the train Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again Stabbed that man right in his heart Gave him a transplant for a brand new start I can't walk through the park, ’cause it's crazy after dark Keep my hand on my gun, ’cause they got me on the run I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw Hear them say "You want some more?", living on a see-saw [Hook] Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under [Verse 5] A child is born with no state of mind Blind to the ways of mankind God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too Because only God knows what you'll go through You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate The places you play and where you stay Looks like one great big alleyway You'll admire all the number-book takers Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers You say "I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool." But then you wind up dropping outta high school Now you're unemployed, all null and void Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did Got sent up for a eight-year bid Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag Spend the next two years as a undercover fag Being used and abused to serve like hell 'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell It was plain to see that your life was lost You was cold and your body swung back and forth But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so... [Hook] Don't push me, ’cause I'm close to the edge I'm trying not to lose my head It's like a jungle sometimes It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Eminem|The Marshall Mathers LP|The Real Slim Shady|[Intro] May I have your attention, please? May I have your attention, please? Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up? We're gonna have a problem here [Verse 1] Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door, and started whoopin' her ass worse than before They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture {Aww!} It's the return of the… "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?" And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha, ha!) Feminist women love Eminem "Chicka, chicka, chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him Look at him, walking around grabbing his you-know-what Flipping the you-know-who," "Yeah, but he's so cute though" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose "My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they? We ain't nothing but mammals -- well, some of us, cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes, then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes… [Hook] I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? [Verse 2] Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records Well, I do, so fuck him and fuck you too You think I give a damn about a Grammy? Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me "But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?" Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears? Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first Little bitch put me on blast on MTV "Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee" I should download an audio on MP3 And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups All you do is annoy me so I have been sent here to destroy you And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me [Hook] I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? [Verse 3] I'm like a head trip to listen to ‘Cause I'm only givin' you things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all I just get on the mic and spit it And whether you like to admit it I just shit it better than 90% of you rappers out can, then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums It's funny, ‘cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30 I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking He could be working at Burger King Spittin' on your onion rings Or in the parking lot, circling, screaming, "I don't give a fuck" With his windows down and his system up So will the real Shady please stand up And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go? [Hook] I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up Please stand up, please stand up? [Outro] Ha, ha, I guess there’s a Slim Shady in all of us Fuck it, let’s all stand up [Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]

We're running right back, here we go again It's so insane, ‘cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snap, “Who's that dude?”, I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength [Hook: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie [Verse 2: Eminem] You ever love somebody so much You can barely breathe when you're with them? You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah, them chills used to get them Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them? You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them Now you're in each other's face Spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them Throw them down, pin them So lost in the moments when you're in 'em It's the rage that took over, it controls you both So they say it's best to go your separate ways Guess that they don't know you ‘Cause today, that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over But you promised her next time you'd show restraint You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window Guess that's why they call it window pane [Hook: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie [Verse 3: Eminem] Now, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me When it comes to love, you're just as blinded Baby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk? Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time? There won't be no next time I apologize even though I know it's lies I'm tired of the games, I just want her back I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire [Hook: Rihanna] Just gonna stand there and watch me burn Well, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry Well, that's all right, because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie

All right then I quit, God, I give up Call it "Evil That Men Do" Lord, forgive me for what my pen do “This is for your sins, I cleanse you, you can repent But I warn you: if you continue, to Hell I send you” And just then the wind blew, and I said... [Hook] Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh I'm as cold as the cold wind blows When it snows and it's 20 below Ask me why, man, I just don't know Know-know-know, know-know, know I'm as cold as the cold wind blows Blow-blow-blows Blow-blow, blows, oh, oh-oh-oh [Verse 3] How long will I be this way? Shady until my dyin' day 'Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say, "So long!"

"Oh, bitches don't like that." Homie, I'll be nicer to women when Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimmin' Man, I'm a cold soul, I roll solo So don't compare me to them other bums over there It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums, yeah I'm bananas, pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-tune The last thing you want to do, is have me spit out a rhyme And say "I was writing this and I thought of you," so...

I let the beat commence So I can beat the sense in your elite defense I got some meat to mince A crew to stomp, and then two feet to rinse I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal One thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeep-full of people MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium Battle a band of phony MC's, and stand the lonely one Imitator, intimidator, stimulator Simulator of data eliminator There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases My thesis'll smash a stereo to pieces My a cappella releases classic masterpieces Through telekinesis, it eases you mentally Gently, sentimentally, instrumentally With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite [Hook] I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell Well, I was sent from it I went to it, serving a sentence For murdering instruments Now I'm trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite [Verse 3] Man, I got evidence, I'm never dense And I've been clever ever since my residence was hesitant To do some shit that represents the MO So I'm assuming all responsibility ‘Cause there's a monster will in me That always wants to kill MCs Mic nestler, slammin' like a wrestler Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy In fact, I can't see, or can't imagine A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin' So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo On my last jam, plus the man who never had a plan B Be all you can be, ‘cause once you make an instant hit I'm tensed a bit, and tempted When I see the sins my friends commit [Hook] I'm Infinite; you heard of Hell Well, I was sent from it I went to it, serving a sentence For murdering instruments Now I'm trying to repent from it But when I hear the beat, I'm tempted To make another attempt at it; I'm Infinite [Outro] '95, '96 ('96) And on and on and on (and on and on)

Eminem|Relapse|Beautiful|[Bridge] Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me And I'm reaching out for you [Verse 1] I'm just so fucking depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump If I could just get over this hump But I need something to pull me out this dump I took my bruises, took my lumps Fell down and I got right back up But I need that spark to get psyched back up In order for me to pick the mic back up I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in I'm starting to feel distant again So I decided just to pick this pen Up and try to make an attempt to vent But I just can't admit or come to grips With the fact that I may be done with rap I need a new outlet And I know some shit's so hard to swallow But I just can't sit back and wallow In my own sorrow, but I know one fact: I'll be one tough act to follow One tough act to follow I'll be one tough act to follow Here today, gone tomorrow But you'd have to walk a thousand miles… [Hook] In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you [Verse 2] I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor Everything's so tense and gloom I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature Of the room, just as soon as I walk in, it's like all eyes on me So I try to avoid any eye contact ‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door For conversation, like I want that I'm not looking for extra attention I just wanna be just like you Blend in with the rest of the room Maybe just point me to the closest restroom I don't need no fuckin' man-servant Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass Laugh at every single joke I crack And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, "Ha! Marshall, you're so funny man You should be a comedian, goddamn!" Unfortunately I am I just hide behind the tears of a clown So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles… [Hook] In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you [Verse 3] Nobody asked for life to deal us With these bullshit hands we're dealt We gotta take these cards ourselves And flip 'em, don't expect no help Now, I could've either just sat on my ass And pissed and moaned Or take this situation in which I'm placed in And get up and get my own I was never the type of kid To wait by the door and pack his bags And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed For a dad to show up who never did I just wanted to fit in in every single place Every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid Even if it meant acting stupid Aunt Edna always told me "Keep making that face it'll get stuck like that" Meanwhile, I'm just standing there Holding my tongue trying to talk *like this* 'Til I stuck my tongue On that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old I learned my lesson then ‘Cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no mo' But I already told you my whole life story Not just based on my description ‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin' Is probably 110% different I guess we would have to walk a mile In each other's shoes at least What size you wear? I wear 10's Let's see if you can fit your feet… [Hook] In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me I'll be you, let's trade shoes Just to see what it'd be like to Feel your pain, you feel mine Go inside each other's minds Just to see what we find Look at shit through each other's eyes But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful They can all get fucked, just stay true to you [Bridge] Lately I've been hard to reach I've been too long on my own Everybody has a private world Where they can be alone Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through? Are you reaching out for me And I'm reaching out for you [Outro] To my babies: stay strong Daddy'll be home soon And to the rest of the world God gave you them shoes that fit you So put 'em on and wear 'em Be yourself, man, be proud of who you are Even if it sounds corny Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful

2Pac|Me Against the World|Dear Mama|[Verse 1 – 2pac] You are appreciated When I was young, me and my mama had beef 17 years old, kicked out on the streets Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place Suspended from school And scared to go home, I was a fool With the big boys breaking all the rules I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years We was poorer than the other little kids And even though we had different daddies, the same drama When things went wrong we'd blame Mama I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell And who'd think in elementary, hey I'd see the penitentiary one day? And running from the police, that's right Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside And even as a crack fiend, Mama You always was a black queen, Mama I finally understand For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man You always was committed A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated [Hook – Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" + 2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? [Verse 2 – 2pac] Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along I was looking for a father he was gone I hung around with the thugs And even though they sold drugs They showed a young brother love I moved out and started really hangin' I needed money of my own, so I started slangin' I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks It feels good putting money in your mailbox I love paying rent when the rent is due I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you ‘Cause when I was low you was there for me And never left me alone, because you cared for me And I could see you coming home after work late You're in the kitchen, trying to fix us a hot plate You just working with the scraps you was given And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin' But now the road got rough, you're alone You're trying to raise two bad kids on your own And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated [Hook – Reggie Green & "Sweet Franklin" + 2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? [Verse 3 – 2pac] Pour out some liquor and I reminisce ‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama And when it seems that I'm hopeless You say the words that can get me back in focus When I was sick as a little kid To keep me happy, there's no limit to the things you did And all my childhood memories Are full of all the sweet things you did for me And even though I act crazy I gotta thank the Lord that you made me There are no words that can express how I feel You never kept a secret, always stayed real And I appreciate how you raised me And all the extra love that you gave me I wish I could take the pain away If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day Everything will be alright if you hold on It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan Is to show you that I understand; you are appreciated [Hook – Reggie Green & Sweet Franklin + 2Pac] Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated) Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama) Sweet lady Lady (Dear Mama) Lady Lady

Eminem|Recovery|Going Through Changes|[Hook] I'm going through changes I'm going through changes [Verse 1] Lately I really feel like I'm rolling for delph, like Philly Feel like I'm losing control of myself, I sincerely Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining But life keeps on complicating And I'm debating on leaving this world this evening Even my girls can see I'm grieving, I try and hide it, but I can't Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty When inside I'm dying? I am finally realizing I need help, I can't do it myself, too weak Two weeks I've been having ups and downs Going through peaks and valleys, dilly-dallying Around with the idea of ending the shit right here I'm hating my reflection I walk around the house trying to fight mirrors I can't stand what I look like, yeah I look fat, but what do I care? I give a fuck, only thing I fear is Hailie I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her… shit [Hook] [Verse 2] I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, napping at noon Yeah, Dad's in a bad mood, he's always snapping at you Marshall, what happened that you… You can't stop with these pills? And you've fallen off with your skills And your own fans are laughing at you It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle? Get up Be a man, stand, a real man would've had this shit handled Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed They say Proof just flipped out Homie just whipped out and bust Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that He wouldn't fucking shoot at nobody, he fights first But dwelling on it only makes the night worse Now I'm popping Vics, Percs and Methadone pills "Yeah, Em, tight verse, you killed it" Fucking drug dealers hang around me like yes men And they gonna do whatever I says when I says it It's in their best interest to protect their investment And I just lost my fucking best friend So fuck it, I guess then… [Hook (with Eminem)] (Don’t know what I’m going through But I just keep on going through changes) [Verse 3] My friends can't understand this new me That's understandable, man, but think how bananas you'd be You'd be an animal too If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo And everybody's looking at you, what you want me to do? I'm starting to live like a recluse And the truth is fame starting to give me an excuse To be at an all-time low I sit alone in my home theater, watching the same damn DVD Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive And it hurts so I fast forward Sleeping pills'll make me feel alright And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night I'll just take a couple more, yeah, you're motherfucking right I ain't slowing down for no one, I am almost homeward bound Almost in a coma, yeah, homie, c'mon, dole 'em out "Daddy, don't you die on me; Daddy, better hold your ground!" Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice? Yeah, baby, hold me down [Hook (with Eminem)] [Verse 4] Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes But somehow I'm pulling through Swear when I come back I'ma be bulletproof I'ma do it just for Proof, I think I should state a few facts cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth Shit it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through I think about the things I would've never got to say to you I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do Hailie, this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too I still love your mother, that'll never change Think about her every day, we just could never get it together Hey, wish there was a better way for me to say it But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day There are just too many things to explain When it rains guess it pours, yes it does Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers Heaven knows I've never been a saint I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history And just today, I looked at your picture, almost as if to say I miss you subconsciously, wish it didn't end this way But I just had to get away, don't know why I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm… [Hook (with Eminem)]

Sway UK|This Is My Demo|Hype Boys|[Verse 1] Hype boys, hype boys, everyone's a killer Drug dealer with a nine mill-a That's not sensible, and I can sense the bull That's why these rappers couldn't see me coming If they were vaginas, with spectacles And I've got the testicles to testify the truth Half these rappers are only gangsters in the booth And they ain't never been to no Pen, they just hold one Me, I be no gangster, I'm just telling you the truth But I run up in the game like "Bang bang bang bang" That's why, that's why everybody keeps saying Have you heard Sway? He's "Nang nang nang nang" That guy that guy's heavy in the game And I've said: why buy this "Fe-Fi-Fo"? But them guys could never defeat my flow Sway, all the way from the U to the K Roll up with Bacardi in the tee-total Getting over the CDs I've sold in it I don’t want them to know that's the gold, innit? That's the goal, innit? Half the haters they ain't doing nothing with a mic but holdin' it, they slow with it So they could never bring the game into the new school I play too brutal Plus I’m out of control like a cross-eyed teacher’s pupil People down in England ain't all wild But some places in Britain ain't the place to raise your child Cos even the royal family ain't all smiles Cos everybody knows, Harry don't look like Charles See me, I've never been to court And I've never been on trial, boy Never been caught even though I've been around, boy What’s that thing in your hand? Put it down, boy Cos you're not a killer, you’re a sound boy [Hook x2] Hype boys, hype boys (Everyone's a bad man now) On the mic boys, mic boys (And everyone's a bad man now) And the semi goes bratatatatatatatata (Yeah right) And the semi goes ratata, bang, bang [Verse 2] The pound is stronger than the dollar, holla Sway, I ran up in this game like a robber without a rubber And now I been around and I'm pro Won a couple of awards, now a round of applause And now I'm making Ps and I'm pleasing my people Not even a Jamiroquai hat could fit my ego ‘Nuff of these rappers ain’t real, they’re just rapping hype Why you shouting all the time? Don't you have a mic? Run up in the club like, be-ow, be-ow Bust two lyrics then, we out, we out Them boys talk too lee-oud, lee-oud But they puss like, meow, meow And they don't really want no war time This rap game is all mine It will never be your time, allow it, bruv, 'cos you're small time And I got more time, so settle down, boy Before I make you look like something like a clown, boy What's that thing in your hand? Put it down, boy Cos you're not a killa, you're a sound boy [Hook] [Verse 3] Are you a liar? If your reply is no, you're lying now Because we live in a lie And then we die and then we're lying down Look at my Adam's apple, it's not that my neck hurts No, no, it's just the truth is hard to swallow And you can see that I'm an expert So let, let me elaborate as I navigate, like a husky But trust me, the truth is, I wouldn't even trust me Many rely in religion, that doesn't make sense Cause that's considered a sin It is really no winning cause every one harbors a liar within them, it's just that we're different Being a bad liar is like having a bad lawyer As soon as they get caught they get the sentence uffed up A good liar's benevolent, with a memory like an elephant Intelligent, and knows exactly when to shhhhh Lies spread around like viruses, so how can I survive in this? Cause even the truth lies (where?) – in people's irises So how can I resist? I had to lie to write this verse Got my talent for twisting words Hence my title, I'm a "lie"ricist When you work the people don't want to leave alone Cause you gotta make money, you don't need the loan I'm a businessman underneath the foam But you lie to the people and lead them on You're not a bad boy, no, I got a bad boy flow Cos when in Rome you do what the Romans do Especially when all roads lead to Rome You need to stop pretending. Your mixtapes are still in boxes cause you don't have a fan in your bedroom What's that thing, in your hand? Put it down, boy Cause you're not a killa, you're a sound boy

Walking in the shoes of a man with a broken leg Flame on the trail headed for the powder keg Last place in the race I ain't never led Like I ain't never bled, time to get up out of bed Serving in the army of one, it's on again [Hook-Dice Raw] Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk it alone I always been on my own, ever since the day I born So I don't mind walking alone Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk it alone I always been on my own, ever since the day I born So I don't mind walking alone [Verse 2- Greg Porn] I'm in a chess match, I'm in a death trap I'm tryna find out where the eggs in the nest at I'm one blood when the sky turns jet black No love in the world can correct that I'm in a slow lane, I'm on my Cobain I'm in the new spot tryna run a old game I got a new chick, put out my old flame No peace, no sleep, no love for a young beast You can put me in a cage You can put me in the jungle where the lion get blazed There ain't no hell like the hell I raise I'd die in the bed I made 'fore I lay with a love I loathe I'm a snake in the garden of bones I'm a loner in a world of clones I'm the piece that don't belong, see I roam Where the Reaper roam 'till they put my name on a stone [Hook] Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk it alone I always been on my own, ever since the day I born So I don't mind walking alone Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk it alone I always been on my own, ever since the day I born So I don't mind walking alone [Verse 3-Black Thought] The longest walk I'll probably ever be on The Road to Perdition, guess I'm fin' to get my plea on I pray these wings strong enough to carry me on I promise every second felt as if it took an eon Walking like the lost boys of Sierra Leone The trail of tears what they got me like a Cherokee on Between the ears something I require therapy on For working to the bone like my name Robert Guillaume I go above and beyond, the duty called, truly y'all Even though they kind of blew me off like a booty call Ask me if I'm just another mouli or a movie star Forced to face the music like a graduate of Juilliard Walk alone, talk alone, get my Charlie Parker on Make my mark alone, shed light upon the dark alone Get my sparkle on, it's a mission I'm embarking on A kamikaze in the danger zone far from home [Hook] Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk it alone I always been on my own, ever since the day I born So I don't mind walking alone Walk alone, I walk alone, you know I walk it alone I always been on my own, ever since the day I born So I don't mind walking alone

The Roots|How I Got Over|The Day|[Hook - Patty Crash] When I wake up, I look into the mirror I can see a clearer, vision I should start living today Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day [Verse 1 - Blu] Yeah, it's like everyday I wake up I stare into space and don't say much Peer in the mirror, feeling dead from the face up Coffee pots, cigarettes, morning J's, Baileys Slowing down my day before it picks up the pace Beats playing since the night before, thinking about writing songs Feeling exhausted from times we toured constant And plus the toxins I sip got me tall Still tipsy, staring at the city from the spot we call Los Angeles Every day is like a blank canvas Carving my initials in the planet like I brand it Hand picked to live this life we take for granted Like a child with an upright bass, we can't stand it Smiling through the trouble we face, trying to manage My way without pumping my brakes and staying stagnant Cause I can sit on my ass or just imagine The madness I did on my path and paint the canvas [Hook - Patty Crash] When I wake up, I look into the mirror I can see a clearer, vision I should start living today Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day [Verse 2 - Black Thought] Before I rise and shine like a neon sign I need the girl of my dreams to give me Einstein And burn the marijuan' like Buju Banton It's my only bonafide break from these confines I need a change of scenery like a montage These kids bringing me the noise like the Bomb Squad And everybody coming at me from the blindside I'm tired, it's hard to open up my eyes wide I listen to some theme music on the iPod And walk around the crib doing little odd jobs Checking my breath, take a view from this high rise Feeling like I'm checking out a game from the sideline I got to try different things in these trying times Twenty-ten is different than it was in nine-five It's come alive time, I picked a fine time For getting open off life like a fine wine [Hook - Patty Crash] When I wake up, I look into the mirror I can see a clearer, vision I should start living today Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day [Verse 3 - Phonte] Sunday morning, plan my day out Whole new blueprint, brand new layout Deep down still don't know if it'll play out But for the first time feel like I done found a way out Skin getting clearer and it feel like I lost weight Stop and say a prayer for the times I lost faith Troubles of the world had me in a cross-face Chicken-wing, sickening, living so off-base But now it's like I'm in the last lap of the car chase And I finally understand my right to choose My preacher man told me it could always be worse Even the three-legged dog still got three good legs to lose So you can stop and refresh the rules Breathe in, breathe out, let it heal all your exit wounds Something inside said that's the move And maybe today I'll restart fresh and new [Hook - Patty Crash] When I wake up, I look into the mirror I can see a clearer, vision I should start living today Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day Cause today is gonna be the day, is gonna be the day

Klashnekoff|The Sagas Of...|Black Rose|[Verse 1] This is dedicated to a black rose I bucked her up on roadSkin made of gold And a cocoa butter glow Got the combo on the go Gave the combos to the codes 07946 Double 0She said give me a call and let me know wah blow We can link and see a showOr smoke weed by the river Watching daffodils blow You dun know As time grows We expand and grow close My black rose I propose we get married But you’re still in college And I’m shotting green on the corner to make a profit Staring at the cosmics Trying to find the logic Spitting my life over melancholic beats But nothing beatsYou and I in deep dialogue My black rose I want to cultivate you neatly Visualize you and me through my third eye DVD Babes it’s deep And can’t be described by speech So I speak through my actions And treat you like diamonds on consignment Protect you from the parasites and pirates And prepare to get violent for our love Tight like strings on a violin Momentary silence as she told me she was pregnant What pregnant? Babes I weren’t expecting this Embraced her with a kiss Overwhelmed with happiness I know it wasn’t planned and your family’s probably pissed But it’s too late, the baby’s due June 28th Your brother’s vexed, your dad dashed you out your mother's place Said when he die, don't want to see your face at his grave But fuck him anyway Just pack your suitcase Cos from now on, it’s just me and you babe Babe don’t watch nothing, I got you [Hook] [Verse 2] My dear father When you died I cried blood So much on my mind that I needed to discuss But words won’t describe, and time is not enough But trust, to my sons I’ll manifest your love Embrace my young cubs with love and bear hugsAnd though the road is rough I spit my life over dubs Till my life turn to dust And as I write these words I’m reminded of the love And the lessons you taught Still I had to learn the hard way Through the hard times You find out who’s your compadres I stargaze as I blaze high grade Thinking bout better days before your life got take-away Couldn’t let you dead in vain So I took your name Son of Niah forever carry your legacy Until they bury me, yeah My dear father I love you like cooked food And I wish you weren’t gone, but I’m dealing with the truth And every time I hear Sizzla I'm reminded of you (It’s a rocky road)And how we cope only God knows Walking a thin line between love and hate, like a tightrope And at times when it seems there’s no hope I still soldier forth holding your picture close (close to my heart, keep soldiering on)

The Streets|Original Pirate Material|Turn The Page|That's it, turn the page on the day, walk away Cause there's sense in what I say I'm forty-fifth generation Roman But I don't know 'em or care when I'm spitting So return to your sitting position and listen It's fitting, I'm miles ahead and they chase me Show your face on TV then we'll see, you can't do half My crew laughs at your rhubarb-and-custard verses You rain down curses but I'm waving your hearses driving by Streets riding high with the beats in the sky All stare, eyes glazed, Garage burnt down The fire raged for forty days and in forty ways But through the blaze they see it fade The sea of black, the beaming heat on their faces Then a figure emerges from the wastage Eyes transfixed with a piercing gaze One hand clutching his sword raised to the sky They wonder how, they wonder why The sky turns white, it all becomes clear They felt lifted from their fears They shed tears, in the light after six dark years Young bold soldiers, the fire burns, crackles and smoulders Five years older and wiser The fires are burning, on fire, never tire Slay warriors in the forests, and on higher we sing Hear the strings rising, the war's over, the bells ring Memories fading, soldiers slaying, looks like geezers raving The hazy fog over the Bullring, the lazy ways the birds sing A new baby's born everyday, few men may be scorned today But look at things the other way cause it may well be your final day And then crowds roar, they slay, they all say I produced this using only my bare wit Give me a jungle, a garage beat, and admit defeat Use war and past injuries, as my metaphor and simile Get all applications in to me before the deadline Cause it's a fine line between strifeful time and a life of crime But you will reach the day And it's all mine, you can take it or leave it I shake and reveal stage tricks like Jimi Hendrix In the afterlife gladiators meet their maker Float through the wheat fields and lakes of blue water To the next life from the fortress Away from the knives and slaughter, to their wives and daughters Once more before the Lord judges over all of us It's in this place you'll see me Brace yourself, cause this goes deep I'll show you the secrets, the sky and the birds Actions speak louder than words Stand by me, my apprentice Be brave, clench fists

The Roots|How I Got Over|Now or Never|[Hook - Dice Raw] Everything's changing around me And I want to change too It's one thing I know It ain't cool being no fool I feel different today I don't know what else to say But I'mma get my shit together It's now or never [Verse 1- Black Thought] I'm sick, sick of waiting in vain, tired of playing the game Thinking of making a change, finally breaking the chains Every phase, every happening, craze When it's said and done, my head is right back in a haze I'm ready for the next chapter and page to start acting my age And part ways with Black Thought from back in the days I'm stargazing from the back of the stage Questioning if who y'all praise is worthy of praise What's the phrase "bygones is bygones?" Niggas who used to be the underdogs is icons People say the light shines once in a lifetime Is this midlife kind a crisis a little bit like mine I'm thinking not now, but right now I need some kinda sign that the future is bright now I fuck around, do the right thing like Spike now The quick and the dead, which one is my lookalike now? I'm moving ahead [Hook] [Verse 2 - Phonte] Opportunities lost because I blew them On the sunniest days of my life, I cry through them Mom's out the picture and Pops, I barely knew him And I would pray to God but I'm tired of lying to him Tired of trying to run from the things inside of us Got a lot of fam, and a lot of admirers Who tell me that I should aspire to be changed But when I think of changing, it's like why even try this shit? My mind hazy and my thoughts, they get distorted I know my good and bad deeds both get recorded You do right so your soul can last But my role is cast before I even audition for it So I don't really see an end to my vice It's just false reformation, no end of my strife Feel the evil overpowering, you can go ahead throw the towel in Cause nigga, that's the end of the fight When you can only see the tunnel at the end of the light Lights out, party over, it's the end of your life And I'm out [Hook] [Verse 3 - Dice Raw] When I look into the mirror and see my own image It feels like there's something else far in the distance Something I wanna see, but something that's resistant And everyday the haunting is growing more persistent I never noticed it before, but now I can't miss it And the constant pounding is driving me ballistic I ran from it for years, but it's still next to me And it's growing stronger, taking even less of me I can't fight it now, I know it's just destiny And I just wonder what's gonna happen when it catches me Will it leave me face down in the Chesapeake? Or will it just start bringing out the best in me? But is the best in me really just the worst in me And if so, yesterday could be my anniversary In sinner's court, sip port and have church with me I'm trying to get rid of these ghosts that's cursing me I'm feeling change is an absolute certainty Cause what's going on is a state of emergency

Saul Williams|Amethyst Rock Star|Penny for a Thought|Cancel the apocalypse! Cartons of the milky way with pictures of a missing planet Last seen in pursuit of an American dream This fool actually thinks he can drive his hummer on the moon Blasting DMX off the soundtrack of a South Park cartoon Niggas used to buy their families out of slavery Now we buy chains and links, smokes and drinks They're paying me to record this, even more if you hear it Somebody tell me what you think I should do with the money Yes, friend, tell me what you think I should do with the money Exactly how much is it gonna cost to free Mumia? What's he gonna do with his freedom? Talk on the radio? Radio programming is just that - a brain washed and gleamed of purpose To be honest, some freedom of speech makes me nervous And you, looking for another martyr in the form of a man Hair like a mane with an outstretched hand In a world of harsh thoughts, reactionary defensiveness, and counter-intelligence What exactly is innocence? Fuck it, I do believe in the existence of police brutality Who do I make checks payable to? (How 'bout I pay you in prayers?) A young child stares at a glowing screen, transfixed by tales of violence His teenage father tells him that *that*'s life, not that Barney shit A purple dinosaur that speaks of love, a black man that speaks of blood Which one is keeping it real, son? Who manufactured your steel, son? Hardcore, ancient elements at the earth's core Fuck it, I'mma keep speaking 'til my throat soars An emcee told a crowd of hundreds To put their hands in the air An armed robber stepped to a bank and told everyone To put their hands in the air A Christian minister gives his benediction while the congregation Hold their hands in the air Love the image of the happy Buddha With his hands in the air Hands up if you're confused. Define tomorrow Your belief system ain't louder than my car system Nigga walked down my block with his rottweiler, a subwoofer on a leash Each one teach one The DJ spins a new philosophy into a barren mind I can't front on it My head nods as if to clear the last image from an etch-a-sketch Something like Rakim said: I could quote any emcee, but why should I? How would it benefit me? Karmic repercussions Are your tales of reality worth their sonic laced discussions? Suddenly, the ground shivers and quakes A newborn startles and wakes Her mother rushes to her bed side to hold her to her breast Milk of sustenance heals and nourishes From the depths of creation life still flourishes Yet we focus on death and destruction, violence, corruption My people, let Pharaoh go What have you bought into? How much will it cost to buy you out? What have you bought into? How much will it cost to buy you out? What have you bought into? How much will it cost to buy you out? (spoken) How much it gonna cost to buy you out of my mind? Penny for a thought. Y'all niggas is half-steppin', wastin' my time Please, nigga, what? You talkin to me? Please baby, baby, baby can I borrow - canIborrow a nickle, a dime A dime, a quarter? Penny for a thought. Penny for a thought How much will it cost to buy you out of Buyin' into a reality that originally bought you? Dime a dozen. Y'all niggas a dime a dozen Penny for a thought, nigga. C'mon, penny for a thought Think fast, think fast. C'mon, time is money Time is money, money is time So I keep 7 o'clock in the bank and gain interest in the hour of God I'm saving to buy my freedom, God, grant me wings I'm too fly not to fly I soared further past humans without wings so I soar And fine tickling the feathers of my wings Flying hysterically over land. Numerically I am seven mountains higher than the valley of death Seven mountains higher than the valley of death Seven dimensions deeper than dimensions of breath (x12, gradually mixed out) We are performing an exorcism on all this keep-it-realism Violent sensationalism In the name of the hip hop that nurtured me, cultured me We are ordering all evil entities to exit this body, leave this body In the name of microphone fiends and a young boy's b-boy dreams We told you to leave this body, leave this body All evil entities, all wannabe emcees Decoys, decoys Send in the true b-boys, the true b-boys Be men, motherfuckers. Be men In the name of Scott La Rock In the name of T-La Rock Motherfuckers that remember how to do the reebok Walk, hop I told you to leave this body Leave this body, leave this body I told you to leave this body Leave this body, leave this body Motherfuckers must think I'm crazy Shit, I think y'all motherfuckers is crazy I want my fuckin' MTV Penny for a thought, nigga, penny for a thought What the fuck have you bought into?

Atmosphere|Seven's Travels|Always Coming Back Home to You|To all my killers and my hundred dollar billers To emo kids that got too many feelings He held the register open while he counted her change I was next in line which meant I was invisible From where I stood I could see that the till was full He didn't look the type to play superhero So I stepped forth and paid for my cigarettes Crept out the store's front door to chase a little breath Bangles in my head, shake the song off Another manic Monday night, its gonna be a long walk A car pulled up, a fixed up Cutlass A woman and a child climbed out and left it running They went inside of the deli, placed an order With the extra dollar fifty bottled water cause the daughter's picky When they came out mommy gave me a glance That said man can love an angel but he's got to take the chance Already knew the deal, I lit one up and walked So they got back in they Oldsmobile, belted up, and took off Thug love on the corner by the Walgreens Looking at me like I'm just another square Saltine As I get closer I notice they showing each other sketches Out of their notebooks, reminded me of my old roots I walk past with a nod and a reminisce Swear to god hip hop and comic books was my genesis Respect the life and the fashions of the children It's the only culture I've got, exactly what we've been building All of a sudden I'm in front of some man No, he's a young'un, but he's got a gun in his hand He looks fifteen, he looks frantic, no, he looks afraid Immediately apprehensive 'til I heard him say "Do you want this? It's not mine, I promise I found it on my block in between a couple garages Didn't want to leave it for a child to stumble over I don't even know how to hold it" It was a thirty eight, the poor man's machete Held it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier than expected Wedged it behind my belt buckle Knowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble The extra strength felt weak But over there on the corner saw what I needed And proceeded to cross the street Put the heat in the mail box to lose it Figured that the post office knows what's best to do with it Mosey down the road, thinking about the old I used to roam this zone through two feet of snow Right here, this used to be a record shop I've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that parking lot I've had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades These alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days Before I was a germ learning how to misbehave All the way to the grave, south side is my resting place Took a right on Lyndale I'm getting near But then the road became empty and the people disappeared The clouds ran away, opened up the sky And one by one I watched every constellation die And there I was frozen, standing in my backyard Face to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star I should've known, walked all the way home To find that she wasn't here, I was still all alone No matter where I am, no matter what I do I'm always coming back home to you They can leave me for dead they can take away my true I'm always coming back home to you Through the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew I'm always coming back home to you As sure as the life in the garden that you grew I'm always coming back home to you No matter where I am, no matter what I do I'm always coming back home to you If only I had known what you already knew I'm always coming back home to you From the heaven I've had to the hell I been through I'm always coming back home to you I'm always coming back home to you

If you gon' come on Dead Presidents son, you gotta come hard son, you gotta come harder than that son, you gotta come harder than that." I was like, man what you mean I came hard? But, that shit always stuck in my mind, so doing this next, you know, doing this The Warm Up I was like, damn, I gotta get on it again, I gotta do it again. Just almost like, just to prove to that nigga and kinda prove to myself that you I can, I can maybe get a little...

Eminem|The Marshall Mathers LP|Drug Ballad|[Intro] Yeah, haha, whoo, shit (Aight, guess what? I ain't coming in yet I'll come in a minute Ayo, this is my love song, it goes like this) [Verse 1] Back when Mark Wahlberg was Marky Mark (fucking faggot!) This is how we used to make the party start We used to mix Hen with Bacardi Dark And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk And by the, sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf And my pre-diction is you're gon' probably fall Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall And everything's spinnin', you're beginnin' to think women Are swimmin' in pink linen again in the sink Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished You are now allowed to officially slap bitches You have the right to remain violent and start wilin' Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you Get in your car, start it, and start drivin' Over the island and cause a 42-car pile-up (Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot Looking for life on this planet, sir, no sign of it All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin' And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it Let me outta this place, I'm outta place I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow I'll be back in an hour or so) [Hook] ‘Cause every time I go to try to leave Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve I don't wanna, but I gotta stay These drugs really got a hold of me ‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" They won't let me ever let 'em go I'm a sucker all I gotta say These drugs really got a hold of me [Verse 2] In third grade, all I used to do Was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubik's Cube 17 years later I'm as rude as Jude Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs I've got no game, and every face looks the same They've got no name, so I don't need game to play I just say whatever I want to whoever I want Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want However, I do show some respect to few This ecstasy's got me standin' next to you Getting sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you We just met, but I think I'm in love with you But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too Wake up in the morning like, "Yo, what the fuck we do?" I gotta go, bitch, you know I got stuff to do ‘Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you But in the long run, these drugs are probably going To catch up sooner or later, but fuck it, I'm on one So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord So it's not a straight line no more 'Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls Shit's stickin' outta our backs like a dinosaur Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more So bye for now, I'm going to try to find some more [Hook] ‘Cause every time I go to try to leave Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve I don't wanna, but I gotta stay These drugs really got a hold of me ‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" They won't let me ever let 'em go I'm a sucker all I gotta say These drugs really got a hold of me [Verse 3] That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it! And what's a little bit of alcohol poisonin'? And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again It's your life, live it however you wanna Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up? It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin' ‘Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin' They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin' Even though you wake up feeling like shit every mornin' But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't But I'm all grown up now and upgraded And graduated to better drugs and updated But I still got a lotta growing up to do I still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew But when it's all said and done I'll be 40 Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out getting smashed [Hook] ‘Cause every time I go to try to leave Something keeps pullin' on my sleeve I don't wanna, but I gotta stay These drugs really got a hold of me ‘Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no" They won't let me ever let 'em go I'm a sucker all I gotta say These drugs really got a hold of me

Atmosphere|Lucy Ford: The Atmosphere EP's|Don't Ever Fucking Question That|[Verse 1: Slug] Enough to hold you to the brightest of lights To place you dangerously close to that sun Enough to acknowledge the flaws you can't ignore And recognize the cause of what's done is done More than enough to put my name behind my ideals And neglect my logic twice daily Enough to keep me looking for my Lucy in the sky with gems When I remember how you used to call me baby Enough to look in my mirror with detest For every tear you shed regardless of why you wept Enough to curse any man who can't appreciate the depth Of the ocean I swam till I ran out of breath [Hook] I love you, don't ever fucking question that That's why we'll probably never get along If I was better at finding the right words to say I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs I love you, I love you (faded) Never, don't ever fucking question that Don't ever fucking question that [Verse 2: Slug] Riding the public transit, I study the blank stares To answer my questions of how and why I got so many grey hairs I take care of the nervous that runs through my extension cord And I reflect on that reoccurring dream where we met the Lord Single file lines, to give her a pound one at a time But when I faced her- I attempted to embrace her, she looked so fine I awokened from my sleep before her bodyguard had a chance to beat me To submission and I still walk with my religion I watched the children scurry in circles around a two-way mirror Worrying about which side of the glass projects the reflection clearer I hear the whispers of the wind trying to get me to grin Gassing me up about the love that I plucked and I've been stuck within For every eclipse that stares at me From the other side of a paper cup of espresso I light a match beneath a kettle And for ever set of lips that become attached and equipped with that program To seek success, I bleed my ethics out a slow drip I know a man who met a woman, don't remember where Big beautiful eyes and light brown hair She was from the burbs, he was from the south side of the city This was back when Franklin Avenue was still pretty Two different worlds apart, but the world is just a small town- We all know how people like to get down Here we go, aquarius, pisces Feel the flow of the fluid as I swim through it to free my soul Push shoved to came, without the glove, numbed the pain The magic from up above what it does for the brain Make the love, paint the picture Write the song, the player met a virgin made a virgo named him sean Make the love, paint the picture Write the song, the player met a virgin made a virgo named him sean Make the love, paint the picture And write that song till the break of dawn [Hook] I love you, don't ever fucking question that That's why we'll probably never get along If I was better at finding the right words to say I wouldn't need to write these motherfucking songs

Immortal Technique|Revolutionary Vol. 1|Dance With The Devil|[Verse 1] I once knew a nigga whose real name was William His primary concern was making a million Being the illest hustler that the world ever seen He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams A corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend She put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder He started hanging out selling bags in the projects Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects He was fascinated by material objects But he understood money never bought respect He built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal I don't project my insecurities in other people He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed [Hook] Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot [Verse 2] So Billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew Starting fights over little shit up on the block Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock Working overtime for making money for the crack spot Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain Tired of the block niggas treating him the same He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood Even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die Standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes Billy realized that these men were well guarded And they wanted to test him before business started Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted So now he had a choice between going back to his life Or making money with made men up in the cyph' His dreams about cars and ice made him agree A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three [Hook] Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences You probably only did a month for minor offenses Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot [Verse 3] They drove around the projects slow while it was raining Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home And so they quietly got out the car and followed her Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor "This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw" So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there She struggled hard, but they forced her to go up the stairs They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground Screaming "Shut the fuck up and stop moving around" The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed So Billy stomped on the bitch until he had broken her jaw The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently And then they all proceeded to rape her violently Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn Ripping her up and choking her until her throat burned Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head [Sample] I'm falling and I can't turn back I'm falling and I can't turn back [Verse 4] Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter Cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her She cried more painfully than when they were raping her His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate His corruption had successfully changed his fate And he remembered how his mom used to come home late Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth? He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there And right then, he knew what it was to be empty and cold And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it After that, they killed his mother, and never spoke about it And listen, cause the story that I'm telling is true Cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom, too And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go In fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked White, brown, yellow and black; color is not restricted You have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never Because the dance with the devil might last you forever (Hidden Track: Diabolical) [Intro: Immortal Technique] Oh y'all motherfuckers thought it was over, huh? Well it’s not You didn’t count on a fallen angel getting back into the grace of god and coming after you Ya’ll niggas ain’t shit Your producers ain’t shit. Your fuckin' A & R ain’t shit I’ll fuckin' wipe my ass with your demo deal Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker’s head off! [Verse: Diabolic] Go ‘head and grip Glocks I’ll snap your trigger finger in six spots You’ll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots I’ll watch you topple flat Put away your rings and holla back Can’t freestyle, you’re screwed off the top like bottle caps Beneath the surface I’m overheatin’ your receiving circuits by unleashin' deeper verses than priests speak in churches What you preach is worthless Your worship defeat the purpose Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service Beyond what y'all fathom I shit on cats and jaw tap ‘em Show no compassion like havin’ a straight-faced orgasm Tour jack ‘em Have his half-a-ten bitch suck my friend’s dick In the mean time, you can french kiss this clenched fist Diabolic A one-man brigade spreading cancer plague Fist fuckin’ a pussy’s face Holdin' a hand grenade So if I catch you bluffin' Faggot, you’re less than nothin' I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction [Verse: Immortal Technique] You motherfuckers are nothing, you cannot harm me I’ll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army Storm the planet huntin' you down, ‘cause I’m on a mission To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms Immortal Technique’ll destroy your religion, you stupid bitch You’re faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix I’m 'bout to blow up like NASA Challenger computer chips Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily I’m like time itself, I’m gonna kill you inevitably Chemically bomb you, fuck usin’ a chrome piece I’m illmatic, you won’t make it home like Jerome’s niece I’ll sever your head diagonally for thinkin' of dissin' me And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy This puppet democracy brain-washed your psychology So you’re nothing, like diversity without equality And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology Usin' numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven Produces more digits than 22 divided by 7 You’re like Kevin Spacey, your style is usually suspect You never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet Your mind is empty and spacious Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture and erases Face it, you’re too basic You’re never gonna make it Like children walking through Antarctica, butt naked

Feet on my chest when I was put to the test You said "goddamn nigga, that ain't how ya get it in" Dashboards for leverage, tall cans for beverage The weed can make you courageous Make a Honda Civic seem so spacious Make five minutes seem like ages, anyway [HOOK] You smell like Care-Free Curl and Nowalaters baby Said you like high-top fades And Jesse Johnson's "Crazay" Seventeen, all on you like chicken and some gravy Learned a lot, thank you much today I'm still campaigning [Verse 2 - Boots] The lake don't smell so bad, now do it?

Canibus|Rip the Jacker|Poet Laureate II|[Intro: James Dickey sample] Uh, I don’t understand how a writer would ever get writer’s block, so-called. My problem is having too much, and being unable to get it down [Verse 1: Canibus] Yo, why is the Ripper so ill? That would be a unpardonable breach of confidence for me to reveal He said "One of these days, all eyes would be on me When they look up in the sky and see the neon C" Rhymes inscribed on a nickel disk encased In glass with an ion beam for longevity For more than ten centuries, impressions and memories The first time machine inventor will mention me Canibus was a visionary indeed He believed light could travel in multiples of C The organic supercomputer that solved the mysteries Of Klein Kaluza with two blue metric rulers Liked Cool J, but thought Stephen Jay Gould was cooler And he never liked to propagate rumors Smoked Canary Island cigars Liked American luxury cars and beautiful Asian broads He had a strong mind, he used to philosophize About rhymes while he was pruning his bonsai He claimed that he had written the greatest rhyme of all time But he would never take it out his archives He wrote two songs per day And was constantly experimenting with his wordplay In his youth he did a report on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey He got an F but he deserved an A I followed his career from the first day It seemed a lack of support contributed to his inert ways I seen him pull in 24 hour workdays With deferred pay, undeterred by the word "shame" Public humiliation was the worst pain He was spinning out of control like a Class 5 hurricane He said he wouldn't want another MC to suffer the same Especially when there's nothing to gain He was the illest alive but nobody would face it He spit until his tongue was too torched to taste it Properly funded corporations carbon dated his latest creations To extract the information They found it utterly amazing They claimed the body of his work was the same thing as a priceless painting Never mattered to him that art galleries hated him Cause Thomas Kinkade called and said he would take 10 Complete enigmas wrapped in puzzles encrypted in language With sound but without shape or signature Kept files in his garage on MS-DOS In a fire-proof pod, he thought it was odd Outside there was a shed with an Oppenheimer lock He apparently kept more wax then Madame Tussaud's We were in total awe, cause it blew our minds So many rhymes that were intricately designed He was Poet Laureate of his time And if you don't mind, I'd like to share some of his rhymes [Verse 2] Alone in my room, looking through the 32X telescope zoom Adjusting the focus of the moon One should not assume the philosophy of David Hume Is nothing more then a subjective conclusion What is the maximum field rate application? The runaway glaciation surrounding the ocean basin Affects the population fluctuation On a continuous basis but that's just the basics The juxtaposition of Canibus' position The precision of something no other has written Way above and beyond what was intended The unparalleled malleable enunciation of a sentence You didn't go to college obviously I can tell by your ungodly unintelligible terminology A remarkable odyssey, the rhymes of modern speeds When the brain orders the body not to breathe Your competency is not up to speed, you're not in my league You couldn't possibly be hotter then me Or oppositely your minus 25 degrees, you'd squeeze But the condensation makes rifle barrels freeze Allow me to speak figuratively, nigga please My intellectual properties are about the size of Greece Your counselor advised you not to speak My counselor advised me to keep rhyming until they stopped the beat In the words of Joseph Heller, "I learned how to write better" Even though it sort of irked me He said he didn't understand the process of the imagination But he felt he was at its mercy Which explains my point perfectly and certainly reinforces The reason why nobody's probably ever heard of me Couldn't understand what I mean by ill Unless you try to translate what I print to film This is the line of will, the circle of time The cycle of eternity, the emergence of 1 line Academic phonetics render critics tongue-tied I've personified dry humor of cum laude alumni A wise man sees failure as progress A fool divorces his knowledge and misses the logic And loses his soul in the process Obsessed with nonsense with a caricature that has no content My style is masterful, multilateral I could battle a fool and be naturally cruel Words of scorn are a disastrous tool From an existentialist's view I'm a better rapper than you Grab the mic and rip your physical fabric in 2 My attitude is fucked up but admirable Different methods interpreted into different forms From entirely different perceptions and seen from different norms Not just spittin' a poem, there’s much more involved There's much more pieces of the puzzle for you to solve 48 orders of mechanical laws And rays of creational cause, enhance the cadence of my bars Maybe I am self-absorbed But that's the effect, to find the cause you should ask my A&R Today is what it is, but only because yesterday was what it was Permitting you heard of Beezlebub A tale of demons and drugs, pissy drunk in the club With the DJ doing the needle rub Chances are you'll never see me son Yeah I know my name's Canibus but I can't help you if you need a dub [Verse 3] I came to holla at some big booty bitches And listen to the speakers thump, where you get conceited from? I'm so nice on the mic, they want to beat me up Its deep as fuck, I ain't seen it all but I've seen enough Really unbelievable stuff There's a lot of times when I want to speak but I'm stuck I should leave this rap shit alone And kick my incredible rhymes in the privacy of my own home My imagination is my own The liberty to speak to freely lyrically on the microphone With a pen in my hand, I bring motion to the enneagram And become "Cani-millenia man" Engrave my back with the emperor's stamp Been spitting scientific rap since the 17th century began Trying to escape the wicked empire of Def Jam And the land where lyrics are bland and heretics hang Every warrior has an axe to bury But he has to learn to discern between enemy and adversary I said to myself, "Germaine, this is insane It's suicide its controlled flight into terrain" I fought to regain control of the plain, but went up in a ball of flames And got banned from the hip-hop hall of fame For two bars I kept hearing in my head Over and over again, it cost me everything [Verse 4] I'm convinced now that more than the truth is at stake Where people create language that pretends to communicate Euphemisms are misunderstood as mistakes But its a bi-product of the ghetto music we make From an extroverted point of view I think its too late Hip Hop has never been the same since '88 Since it became a lucrative profession There's a misconception that a movement in any direction is progression Even though the potency of it lessens Big money industries writing checks to suppress the question And nobody gives a fuck no more, no one goes to the book store Ever since the confluence of Moore's Law But I stay in the lab like Niels Bohr His son Aage, Edward Lawrence, and Leo Szilard Lyrically I take rap music and turn the knob To the right full throttle and added panache Why would I argue with my own conscience over the truth? That's like me telling myself, "Don't tell me what to do" Dialysis and analyses of battle MC's Sometimes I say things I myself can't believe My lyrical is so skillfully elliptical I can understand how it makes you miserable You wonder why I never let you play your beats for me Or why I keep my studio enshrouded in secrecy You wonder whats my infatuation with Alicia Keys "Canibus why don't you speak to me?" Yo, I meant it when I said no one can shine on a song that features me That's why I said it so vehemently You need to replace the hate with respect I'm probably the best yet, Poet Laureate [Outro — James Dickey sample] Generally I take… I go with the given, you know, with what comes ta me over, the celestial wireless… Whenever it comes. You’re lucky when you get it

Cunninlynguists|Southernunderground|Seasons|[Intro: Masta Ace] One two It's Masta Ace, Cunninlynguists We about to get into the seasons The seasons of hip hop How we gonna start it? [Verse 1: Masta Ace] As we spring back to the past, it was all happening fast We glorified coke and smoking crack in a glass When b-boys danced to the latest jam You could say this man was the greatest fan When shoelaces were fat, and all the rapper's faces were black And light-brown, a box with the right sound was all you needed When it blast, they must move You just proved you're hard like L in Krush Groove And songs started to drop, Ain't nobody start at the top Before Preme (DJ Premier) learned the art of the chop This is way before SP's and MPC's And long before CD's and MP3's The game started to bloom and blossom And masters ready for the cermony, like a groom in costume Growth from the rain of the previous years I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears Yeah [Verse 2: Deacon the Villian] As Summer's heatwaves ascended in it's splendid manner Green was flooding our scene, although the skin was tanner "Fuck The Police!!" jumpin over radio scanners It was hot in the shade, wet paint all over the canvans Fuck Vanilla Ice cones, we had T, Cube's Amerikka's Most And wanted that Chronic on the Left-Coast Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming Backstrokin' through Dark Sides and Illmatic beginnings Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum It was 2 Live, Florida crews caught heat for rappin' But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide Strictly 4 My Niggas that were ready to die in the ride I wish the summer's vibe could've lasted forever To bad we had to have a change in that weather, that shit was beautiful [Hook] Lauryn Hill: Seasons Change, mad things rearrange Ladybug: Play me in the winter Play me in the summer Play in the autumn Any order [Lauryn Hill: Seasons Change, mad things rearrange] Andre 3000: Trees bright and green turn yellow brown, autumn caught em See all them leaves must fall down Verse 3: [Kno] As the East vs. West winds blew, causing two Legends to Fall like maple leaves from escalated beef Assumed that the worst was over Til these cats started wearing shiny costumes like the 31st of October The weather's colder, but the word jacket/jack it Is what they did to people's styles Not what they covered they backs with Tactics of the skill impaired No Limit to what they'll do when the green is scarce Some be Thanksgiving for who they know While others get jerked for loot Cause getting signed ain't a turkey shoot No respect for the pilgrims who paved the way so you could rock that Just pop crap and Plymouth Rock-Rap Beyond gimmicks and fake plastic tits Outkast and Raekwon dropped fall classic discs Born to Roll, so I'm taking you back to school days of autumn Before the bottom dropped out in 2K [Verse 4: SOS] By the dawn of the new millennium we saw bright chains Winter brought along platinum causing the ice age No more Gold, no more YO! MTV RAPS Now we got R&B cats stealing classic rap tracks In winter it's snowed in like the temperature's below ten Citizens open up shows for more snowmen Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin Jolly, fat, white men get paid when rap hits the shelves And artists themselves get treated like Elves Matter of fact, Santa's gotten so greedy when a rapper sells You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells What the hell! You need cells and 2 ways for chicks to bone ya? And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia Even at the beaches of Daytona it's gotten colder But it's about time for the cycle to start over (echo) How we gon' start it?

Eminem|Encore|Like Toy Soldiers|[Intro] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down [Hook] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers [Verse 1] I'm supposed to be the soldier Who never blows his composure Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders, I ain't never supposed to show it My crew ain't supposed to know it Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino It don't matter I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle 'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em That Ja shit, I tried to squash it It was too late to stop it There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it I heard him say Hailie's name on a song And I just lost it it was crazy The shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit And even though the battle is won, I feel like we lost it I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it That was never my object, for someone to get killed Why would I want to destroy something I helped build? It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good I went through my whole career Without ever mentioning And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouth And talking about something that I knew nothing about Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth While he's all over TV Down-talking the man who literally saved my life Like, fuck it, I understand This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business I'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, ‘cause… [Hook] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers [Verse 2] There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin' But now it's elevated ‘Cause once you put someone's kids in it The shit gets escalated it ain't just words no more, is it? It's a different ball game You call names and you ain't just rappin' We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin' Me and Dre had sat with him Kicked it and had a chat with him And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him Fuck it, "50, smash him! Mash him and let him have it!" Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction Some receptionist at the Source Who answers phones at his desk Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record But now he's fucked the game up, ‘cause one of the ways I came up, was through that publication The same one that made me famous Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'? Well, fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him then! But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc And he's inherited mine, which is fine Ain't like either of us mind We still have soldiers that's on the front line That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus To show 'em we love 'em back And let them know how important it is To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is But I ain't tryin' to have none of my people hurt or murdered It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin' I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin' Off at your jaws, well, then I can ‘Cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'. I'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience, ‘cause… [Hook] Step by step, heart to heart Left, right, left We all fall down like toy soldiers Bit by bit, torn apart We never win But the battle wages on for toy soldiers

You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air of the Night" about that guy who could've saved that other guy from drownin' But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him? That's kinda how this is You could've rescued me from drowning Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall I loved you, Slim, we could've been together – think about it! You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep And you dream about it And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it I hope your conscience eats at you And you can't breathe without me See, Slim--shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see, I ain't like you ‘Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more And then she'll die too Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

How far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that And here's an autograph for your brother I wrote it on a Starter cap I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that shit just clowning, dawg Come on, how fucked up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls When you get down some And what's this shit about us meant to be together? That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other I really think you and your girlfriend need each other Or maybe you just need to treat her better I hope you get to read this letter I just hope it reaches you in time Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you But Stan, why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan I just don't want you to do some crazy shit; I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk And she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape But they didn't say who it was to Come to think about it, his name was… it was you, damn

Jay Z|In My Lifetime, Vol. 1|You Must Love Me|[Intro: Kelly Price] Throughout my life No matter what I've done You've been merciful and your love endureth Through all things For that I am eternally grateful [Verse 1: Jay-Z] Since my date of birth bought you nothing but hurt Play those video games, stole change from ya purse Sat on the cold court bench 'til I was arraigned in ya skirt Saw the pain in ya face, still you maintained a smirk All you did was motivate me, "Don't let 'em hold you back" What I do? I turned around and I sold you crack I was a bastard for that, still I'm drowning in shame Just remember one thing now: you're not to blame You was newly separated tryin' to escape ya world And through my thirst I didn't help you I just made things worse I hated me and everybody that created crack Had me thinkin' the newest kicks and the latest gat Still haven't apologized, so please play this back While I try to come to terms with such a heinous act You know in more than one way cocaine numbs the brain All I did was think about how the funds once came Then I ran across this memory and it stung the brain How can you ever destroy the beauty from which one came That's a savage you're the reason why me and these beats make a marriage Why I rhyme above average and I ain't shit Glad you got yourself together, no thanks to me Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be You must love me [Hook: Kelly Price] You must love me... Say that you love me All I know say that you must love me Ohh yeah [Verse 2: Jay-Z] We used to fight every night but I never would suffer Just smile, my big brother's tryna make me tougher As we grew fussing and fighting continued As I plundered through ya stuff and snuck ya clothes to school Got intense real intense as we got older Never believed it would lead to me poppin' one in your shoulder Where my rings? Knew you had it cause you took too long As Mickey, Annie and the girl that bought it looked on Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand told you step outside Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride Made our way down the steps, maybe you thought it was just a threat Or maybe ya life was just that crazy and you was beggin' for death Try to justify this in my young mind But the adrenaline and my ego hurt combined Drove me berzerk, saw the devil in your eyes, high off more than weed Confused I just closed my young eyes and squeezed What a sound! Opened my eyes just in time to see ya stumbling to the ground Damn! what the fuck I done now? Runnin' around in a circle thinking I'm assed out Hot gun burnin' my waist, ran straight to Jaz' house Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga And ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga Left the scene, how could I go out that way? Still you asked to see me in the hospital the next day You must love me [Hook: Kelly Price] You must love me... What after all the wrong I've done I know you must [Verse 3: Jay-Z] Everything in my power and within my frame To protect you from this life and keep you away from the game But you was one of the few people that I can trust And the fact of the matter I slang these pies for us You put the pressure on me daily, rarely would you let it go Was a thousand and one times I had to tell you no When it was one of those days when nobody was around And I needed emergency trip out of town Searched my mental Rolodex for all the numbers I know As you stared in my face asking me could you go I'm agreed said sender everything'll go smooth Just tell her what to do and everything'll go through (Strapped her body with them thangs) As you boarded the plane Couldn't explain these strange feelings that I caught and the pain I'm thinkin' why would I send you when I knew it ain't right I'm thinkin' what would make you sacrifice ya life You must love me [Hook: Kelly Price] (You must love me repeats in background) After everything that I've done wrong I know inside you must love me I know that you love me You showed me I know it I know Say that you love me Say that you love me I know you must love me Oh yes you do Inside I know it You've always shown it You love me yea yeah Oh yeah I know that you love me

Cause I created you, irresponsibly Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of The start of somethin', I'm not ready to bring into the world Had myself believin' I was sterile I look into mother's stomach, wonder if you are a boy or a girl Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb But she and I agree, a seed we don't need You would've been much more than a mouth to feed But someone, I would've fed this information I read To someone, my life for you I woulda had to leave Instead I lead you to death I'm sorry for takin' your first breath, first step, and first cry But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family I don't wanna, go through the drama of havin a baby's momma Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father For a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do For me to live forever I can only do that through you Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son I could have sacrificed goin' out To think my homies who did it I used to joke about, from now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control Cause 315 dollars ain't worth your soul 315 dollars ain't worth your soul 315 dollars ain't worth it [Hook - Lauryn Hill] I never dreamed you'd leave in summer You said you would be here when it rained Why didn't you stay [Verse 2] Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself You had our child in you, I probably never feel what you felt But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are Through our trials and tribulations, child's elimination An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation Back and forth my feelings was pacin' Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it But even that's a lie in less than two weeks, we was back at it Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust Bustin', more than the sweat in somebody you trust Or is it that we don't trust each other enough And believe, havin' this child'll make us have to stay together Girl I want you in my life cause you have made it better Thinkin' we all in love cause we can spend a day together We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives It's too many black women that can say they mothers, but can't say that they wives I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding But I want our parenthood to come from planning It's so much in my life that's undone We gotta see eye to eye, about family, before we can become one If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from But I'm walkin', findin' myself in my God So I can, discipline my son with my rod Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed Though his death was at our greed, with no one else to blame I had a book of African names, case our minds changed You say your period hasn't came, and lately I've been sleepy So quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy [Hook x2]

2Pac|Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...|Keep Ya Head Up|[Intro] Little something for my godson Elijah And a little girl named Corin [Verse 1] Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice I say the darker the flesh then the deeper the roots I give a holla to my sisters on welfare 2Pac cares if don't nobody else care And I know they like to beat you down a lot When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep your head up And when he tells you you ain't nothing, don't believe him And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him ‘Cause, sister, you don't need him And I ain't trying to gas ya up, I just call 'em how I see 'em You know what makes me unhappy? When brothers make babies and leave a young mother to be a pappy And since we all came from a woman Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman I wonder why we take from our women Why we rape our women, do we hate our women? I think it's time to kill for our women Time to heal our women, be real to our women And if we don't we'll have a race of babies That will hate the ladies that make the babies And since a man can't make one He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one So will the real men get up? I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep your head up [Hook] Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter [Verse 2] Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me He had me feeling like black was the thing to be And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough And though we had it rough, we always had enough I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two And I realize Momma really paid the price She nearly gave her life to raise me right And all I had to give her was my pipe dream Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen I'm trying to make a dollar out of fifteen cents It's hard to be legit and still pay the rent And in the end it seems I'm heading for the pen I try to find my friends, but they're blowing in the wind Last night my buddy lost his whole family It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity It seems the rain'll never let up I try to keep my head up and still keep from getting wet up You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours They got money for wars but can't feed the poor Say there ain't no hope for the youth And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future And then they wonder why we crazy I blame my mother for turning my brother into a crack baby We ain't meant to survive, ‘cause it's a set-up And even though you're fed up Huh, you got to keep your head up [Hook] Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things are gonna get easier Keep ya head up, ooh, child Things'll get brighter [Verse 3] And uh, to all the ladies having babies on they own I know it's kinda rough and you're feeling all alone Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em ‘Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more ‘Cause ain't nothing worse than when your son Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo' You can't complain you was dealt this Hell of a hand without a man, feeling helpless Because there's too many things for you to deal with Dying inside, but outside you're looking fearless While tears is rolling down your cheeks You steady hoping things don't fall down this week ‘Cause if it did, you couldn't take it And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it And now my son's getting older and older and colder From having the world on his shoulders While the rich kids is driving Benz I'm still trying to hold on to surviving friends And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up But please, you got to keep your head up

Drake|So Far Gone (EP)|Fear|[Intro] This is why I do this shit I think they call this, venting [Verse 1] Look, this is me, still the same They want the hits, I play the game No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain It all comes spilling out like I hit a vein What up, Lil Bro? What up, Slum Ville? I hope you know that y'all the reason I have fun still The fans thinking that we all signed for one mil Equal opportunity rapping, that shit is unreal That ain't how it works, that ain't that how it goes And I been getting high just to balance out the lows And I could use a writer just to balance out my flows But I never share my thoughts, this is all a nigga knows And every time I try, it opens up my eyes These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised And I would be performing this as long as I'm alive So every word I utter will be mine [Hook] Don't believe the lies, look me in my eyes Please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me I remember you, this feeling isn't new So please don't be scared of me, please don't be scared of me [Verse 2] (Don't take this the wrong way but, uh) I never cried when Pac died But I probably will when Hov does And if my tears hold value then I would drop one For every single thing he showed us And I'll be standing in a puddle I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble And I'mma keep it honest, I'm so tired of being subtle It's just me, 40, O, and Nik standing in a huddle Staring at the members of my team Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams I hope you tell your families this shit ain't what it seems But y'all the reason for a lot of my devotion You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless And know I pop bottles cause I bottle my emotions At least I put it all in the open [Hook] [Verse 3] Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year Yeah, I swear that we making a killing here I should be on top of the world just chilling here But it's funny having fans Who find you before anybody ever has the chance And build you up, so you could be the biggest in the game And realize when you're there, sometimes the shit don't feel the same Yeah, and plus things are just surreal at home People think I've changed just cause my appeal has grown And now security follow me everywhere So I never actually am alone, I just always feel alone I think I'm scared of what the future holds I was wishing for some things and now am used to those Every girl I meet thinks I'm fucking groupie hoes The honesty of my music has left me too exposed All my old friends think I got a new crowd And people seem to notice every time I do smile I guess that mean they come few and far between Even know I'm living out what you would call the dream And my uncle ain't even messaging me And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me I hope this isn't one of those forever things It's funny how money can change everything [Hook]

Lowkey|Soundtrack to the Struggle|Voices of the Voiceless|[Lowkey] From West End to the West Bank I write righteous rhymes with my right and wrestle the devil with my left hand Never work for a Zionist, never been a yes man My art is like Rembrandt painting pictures of death camps The average person is allergic to the words of wisdom This is for everyone of Saddam's Kurdish murder victims And all the pure souls that never had the chance to speak Truth pumps in my arteries and causes my heart to beat For soldiers haunted and tortured by guilty memories Who realised too late to reveal their real enemy It's all dead wrong For every victim of racist persecution from Auschwitz to Hebron My words may sting cowards For people that were atomised by the Thermite in the Twin Towers Those living through the wars Ask me what I do this for Put the world in its place before it put you in yours [Hook] (Singer - Rochelle Rose) What happens under darkness shall come to light Can't silence us even though you try (Lowkey) You can try to avoid us but it's pointless You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless (Singer - Rochelle Rose) Take our freedom, Can't take our pride Come what may we will survive (Lowkey) You can try to avoid us but it's pointless You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless [Immortal Technique] Keep my third eye hidden under my New York fitted A crazy unmarried man that deserves to be committed The future is encrypted in my troubled lyrics Dream that I've been somewhere for weeks, then wake up in a couple minutes Sweat dripping with visions of population control Thoughts overflowing my world like the melting of the North Pole My people are targeted by military crack committees So I'm bucking at the feds like natives in Rapid City Reality savage, my words are like a riot in Paris The voice of the voiceless, that voice is social imbalance So stand strong or sit harder in your mental palace Blinded inside a Kingdom united to its old habits But now, Middle Passage coming, War Chant, African drumming Gatling gun humming Rapid fire mechanism, reckless living That checks the rhythm of perfectionism Slave condition While you're singing God save the system [Hook] (Singer - Rochelle Rose) What happens under darkness shall come to light Can't silence us even though you try (Lowkey) You can try to avoid us but it's pointless You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless (Singer - Rochelle Rose) Take our freedom, Can't take our pride Come what may we will survive (Lowkey) You can try to avoid us but it's pointless You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless [Lowkey] Detain my body, but you can't imprison my mind If it's my time I'll probably die with my fist in the sky These are the thoughts of a man who can't escape from his coma Cries of a young virgin girl who got raped by them soldiers [Immortal Technique] Birthing a screaming bastard, post colonial nation Subject to childhood diseases, famine, war and inflation Education molded you into your masters image And you forgot who the fuck you were before the war was finished [Lowkey] You're hearing the ghosts of Nagasaki, You're hearing Hiroshima Beautiful babies being born with the weirdest features You might never see me in the charts But Inshallah my seed can see peace in Iraq [Immortal Technique] But peace and freedom can never be given That's historically forbidden, Cos only collision is the recipe Changing the course of destiny So I'm strapped with weaponry [Lowkey & Immortal Technique] Cause the government don't give a fuck about protecting me [Hook] (Singer - Rochelle Rose) What happens under darkness shall come to light Can't silence us even though you try (Lowkey) You can try to avoid us but it's pointless You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless (Singer - Rochelle Rose) Take our freedom, Can't take our pride Come what may we will survive (Lowkey) You can try to avoid us but it's pointless You can never avoid the voices of the voiceless"

Eminem|Relapse|My Darling|[Verse 1] If I would've rapped about the crap that's out That's the route you probably want me to take ‘Cause you're just dying to know what I think Hear my take on some other rappers If I was to say somethin' about Paul Wall You'd probably crap in your pants ‘Cause I'm white and he's white So he's like my competition, I mean, right? Nope, Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba So b-b-b-b-b-b, but I don't compete with nobody I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle And dance around my opponents, do donuts Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome I'm like a sleepin' giant, and when I awake I'm like Dre I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em full of poison And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em And smack 'em with the backwards E on the Eminem emblem I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him, tell him why, look him dead in the eye, then waste him And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls For this rap game and it g-g-goes One-two-three, chk-chk, one-two-three Chk-chk, one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me Everybody bores me, they're just so corny So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror The mirror grows lips and it whispers: "Come nearer."

Dye it back, come on, try it!" Ahh, no! I told you leave me the fuck alone, will you? "But I'm here to rebuild you." But I already killed you! "But, Shady, we were meant for each other Think about your mother," yeah, so what of her? "You think about what she did to you and your little brother All them foster homes." Fuck you, mothafucka! I had you beat! "No, I was playin possum Remember? I let you watch your little girls blossom I gave you enough time, your soul's mine I'm taking it back." You fuckin' bitch, why?! "Because I love you, look a little closer Isn't that us on that poster?" [Hook] My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling You and me were meant to be together, my darling And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling ‘Cause I possess your soul Your mind, your heart and your body I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling You and me were meant to be together, my darling And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling ‘Cause I possess your soul Your mind, your heart and your body [Verse 3] "Shady, listen! (Shady!) You hear that? They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back!" But I don't want it back, "Yes, you do," no, I don't "Yes, you do; you're gonna regret it later," no, I won't "I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor." Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday "Well, I got him on the phone right now." (Slim) You're lying! (Yo, Slim) How, why now? What up, Dre? (Check this out, Slim, I gotta talk to you I don't know, it just seems like ever since you got off your Drugs you became a lot softer) But, Dre, all that Shady is, is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka (Well, just think about it, Slim, I'm here Just hit me back and let me know what's up) Fuck this mirror! "I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you Let me guide you," fuck you! Die, you son of a bitch! "Put the gun down!" bye-bye! Okay, I'm still alive "So am I too! You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to Ha ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you? You remember that night you prayed to God You'd give anything to get a record deal, well, Dre signed you This is what you wanted your whole life, Marshall, right? Ooh Look at this house, look at these cars; they're so nice, woo! Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price too? That you just now seeing the downside too Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too Ain't even sure if your kids like you Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle But together we can break the cycle Marshall…" What?! "No one's gonna love you like I do." [Hook] My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling You and me were meant to be together, my darling And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling ‘Cause I possess your soul Your mind, your heart and your body I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling You and me were meant to be together, my darling And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling ‘Cause I possess your soul Your mind, your heart and your body

I can't rap anymore, I just murdered the alphabet Drug sickness got me doing some bugged twitches I'm withdrawing from crack so bad my blood itches I don't rap to get the women; fuck bitches! Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes Never ran with a clique; I'm a posse Kamikaze, strapping a motherfucking bomb across me From the second I was born my momma lost me I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place My worst day on this earth was my first birthday Retarded? What did that nurse say? Brain damage? Fuck! I was born during an earthquake [Hook] For all the weed that I've smoked – yo, this blunt's for you To all the people I've offended – yeah, fuck you too!

Eminem|Straight from the Lab|Bully|[Intro] Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging [Verse 1] "I'm withholding my anger Though I'd like to be the strangler Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck It's my right to insist That he acknowledge my existence But he just displays complete lack of respect" That's what he says to himself As he use his magazines to trash me As he sits with both his feet up at his desk Smokes a bag of his weed And starts imagining things And he just can't see that he's manically depressed And in his jealousy and envy It just whirls him in a frenzy As he turns on MTV and sees my face He don't exist in this world So he just twists and he twirls Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage And it's destroying him slowly Cause he does not even know me Even though he sees me everywhere he goes So he just tortures himself He has no fortune and wealth So he extorts someone else to get his dough And now he's acting like a bully So he tries to push and pull me But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad He has no choice but to scream And raise his voice up at me Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared [Hook] You ain't no motherfucking (bully) And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully) I won't allow it, ain't gonna cower to no (bully) I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully) Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...) And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...) [Verse 2] Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies No more unfortunately There's so many other motherfuckers that just are They just keep hounding at me Now that I'm down with 50 Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja [laughter] But his ass is such a puppet Irv could shove his whole hand up it And just make him say what he wants him to say But Suge has Irv's on a string And Irv's so nervous that he Says anything to this man to keep him at bay So now Ja thinks that he's so tough And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf And they go huff and puff and blow our label down But our building's made out of bricks So you ain't taking out shit And dog you just did a song with Bobby Brown So now you try to pull a race card And it backfires in your face hard Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit Plus this stylist that you fucked When you was ecstasied up Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch [Hook] You must be taking to much (E...) [Verse 3] Now what bothers me the most About hip-hop is we so close To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac We just lost Jam Master J Big L got blasted away Plus we lost Bugs, Slang Ton, and Freaky Ta It's like a never-ending cycle That just seems to come full circle Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard I'm not excluding myself Cause I been stupid as well I been known to lose it when someone says something smart But as we grow as men We learn to let shit go, but then again There's only so much bullshit we can really stand We all got reps to uphold When someone steps on our toes It's no exception, it goes for every man But if Irv really gave a fuck About Ja like he claims he does He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs But he just keeps feeding him pills So if that E doesn't kill him Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed Dawg, I'm talking to you straight If the situation escalates Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game And if I get killed for this rap I got a million in cash That says I will get you back in Hailie's name [Hook] Irvine, get your boy off that (E...) [Spoken] Get at me, dog Holla

2Pac|Tupac: Resurrection OST|One Day at a Time|[Verse 1: 2Pac] Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming ‘Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human being So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape ‘Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die Before we learn to fly? Somebody else should try Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change So I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe Communities in need of people that will lead Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try Until the day I die, I promise to be wise With my heart open, greed brings only misery Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies [Verse 2: Eminem] We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate ‘Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes But we ain't, its grain to go against With every artist comes the image he portrays And the picture that he paints But in the midst of all this anger and this angst Never once did you heard me say I'm a gangster And I ain't hear no complaints But I know that I will always continue to grow As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee That's why the fuck I remain sucker free To this day, the game will never be the same No matter how much fame and success they attain There will never be another me And no matter what they do, there will never be another you You can search, but you'll never find You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds We will never die, we are forever alive [2Pac] And we continue growin', one day at a time [Verse 3: Young Noble] Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype Rappers are regular people minus money and lights Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin' And the kids think beef is they only option Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged My memories took a dive, my Machiavelli lives on You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap? We needing a change, the drama remains the same [Verse 4: Hussein Fatal] I spend my whole life fightin' myself That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help And hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt Yeah, that there is a fight in itself So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself No matter how much I try, stay alive I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride [Verse 5: E.D.I. Mean] Heard frivolous beats, we past that I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in And collect on my ASCAP The rappers in the game ain't changed And I finally realize that we're not in the same game The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin' One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind [2Pac] And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn

Drake|So Far Gone|Say What's Real|[Verse: Drake] Why do I feel so alone? Like everybody passing through the studio Is in character as if we acting out a movie role Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know And I don't have the heart to give these Bitch niggas the cue to go So they stick around kicking out feedback And I entertain it as if I need that I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that My privacy about the only thing I need back but It's hard to think of them polite flows When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes And you still make it even when they say your flight closed Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows Life was so full, now this shit just being lipo'd Always said I'd say it all on the right track But in this game you only lose when you fight back Black diamond bracelets Showing you the basics, I can't live and hold the camera Someone gotta tape this And make hits like a bitch that's married, I ain't miss24 hours from greatness, I'm that close Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt Transitioning from fitting in to standing out Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South Watchin' Hov's show Embarrassed to pull my camera out And my mother embarrassed To pull my Phantom out So I park about five houses down She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown But I don't wanna feel the need to wear disguises around So she wonder where my mind is, accounts in the minus But yet I'm rolling round the fuckin' city like your highness Got niggas reactin' without a sinus Cause what I'm working with is timeless And promoters try to get me out to they club They say I have fun but I can't imagine how Cause I just seen my ex-girl, standing with my next girl Standing with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now And shit could get weird unless they all down And so I stay clear, we from a small town Everybody talks and everybody listen But somehow the truth just always comes up missing I've always been something that these labels can't buy Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul And Sylvia be tellin' Tez, "Damn, Drake fly" And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker, I know That was your bad, how could you pass up on 'em? He just take them records and he gas up on 'em Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on 'em Surprised no one ever put your ass up on 'em" Oh they did Poe, at least they tried to And that's what happens When you spitting what's inside you But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video And they think they can market you However they decide to nahh But 40 told me to do me And don't listen to anybody that knew me Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me And if you think I changed in the slightest could've fooled me Boy, in my city I'm da 2-3 Drug dealers live vicariously through me I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy I'm just not the social type And campus life is crazy understand I could get money with my eyes closed Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know Cause they need it much more than I ever will I got new shit, I'm gettin' better still Little niggas put my name in they verses Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal Future said cause this 'Ye shit you better kill And I think this got this "Making of a Legend" feel Problem with these other niggas they ain't never real Yea ... that's all I can say

Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me, ma? But guess what, you're getting older now And it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick He's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now You should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her—she won't even be at your funeral See, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong, bitch, do your song Keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get? You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died And you said you wished it was me? Well, guess what, I am dead—dead to you as can be! [Hook] I'm sorry, Momma, I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry But tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)

Immortal Technique|Revolutionary Vol. 1|Speak Your Mind|[Intro] You have to speak the truth You have to speak your mind [Verse 1: Immortal Technique] Every time I speak my mind I'm lyrically critical The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal Beyond anything ever studied thats metaphysical Man fuck a minority, I'm not politically minimal But obviously terminologies that are statistical Are manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal Transmitted by monopolized media visuals So I riddle hypocritically pitiful criminals Habitually utilizing typical rituals With false pretense in attempts to be spiritual TO individuals who believe in biblical miracles Instead of themselves, because they're not thinking original And the color of their skin makes them feel invisible Like microscopic miscarriages lynched wit the umbilical Only a fuckin imbecile would think their uncorrectable Cause your susceptible to becoming more than a spectacle Remember that your flesh your blood and you body are dissectable Ill beat you until your vegetable And wake up in a hospital covered in poisonous chemicals In a fetal position wit your face sewn to your testicles Thinkin that you were kidnapped by extraterrestrials You got heart? I'm the blood that pumps in your ventricles Technique, I'm like ya soul nigga.. indispensable Wit no respect for those that cower at the hour of revolution Cause the government owes my people restitution Instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution Conclusion is that you'll have to violently silence me Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy In school my teachers blinded me But now I can see I'm mentally and revolutionarily free Broadening Horizons about what my people could be If we wasn't set up to get shot locked or OD You see families bleed because of corporate greed And monopolizing weed is virtually impossible So it won't be legalized and thats another obstacle But I'm still rollin up pocket fulls of tropical The governments involved directly so its unstoppable Like a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins that invade the ecological Improbable that the average intellect could understand So I encrypted this into hip hop thats in high demand And spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband Stomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature Cause I'm tryin to save the earth, but your just next in line to rape her

2Pac|2Pacalypse Now|Brenda's Got a Baby|[Intro: Dave Hollister] Brenda's got a baby [Verse: 2Pac] I hear Brenda's got a baby But Brenda's barely got a brain A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family Well let me show you how it affects our whole community Now Brenda really never knew her moms And her dad was a junkie putting death into his arms It's sad, cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know Just cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation Brenda got herself a boyfriend Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she Went out and had a church of kids As long as when the check came they got first dibs Now Brenda's belly's getting bigger But no one seems to notice any change in her figure She's twelve years old and she's having a baby In love with a molester, who's sexing her crazy And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever And dreams of a world where the two of them are together, whatever He left her and she had the baby solo She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know so She didn't know, what to throw away and what to keep She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes Now the baby's in the trash heap bawling Momma can't help her, but it hurts to hear her calling Brenda wants to run away Momma say, you making me lose pay There's social workers here every day Now Brenda's gotta make her own way Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job She tried to sell crack but end up getting robbed So now what's next, there ain't nothing left to sell So she sees sex as a way of leaving hell It's paying the rent, so she really can't complain Prostitute, found slain and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby

MF DOOM|MM.. FOOD|Deep Fried Frenz|[Intro] Before we go any further Friends [MF DOOM] As you call 'em, they call you when they need something Trees for the blunt, the g's for the front I found a way to get peace of mind for years And left the hell alone: Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone Send me a letter, or better, we could see each other in real life Just so you could feel me like a steel knife At least so you could see the white of they eyes Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies Asssociates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies Close, but really don't know me Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies Some come around when they need some money Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies Fam be around whether you paid or bummy You could either ignore this advice, or take it from me Be too nice and people take you for a dummy So nowadays he ain't so friendly Actually he woulda even made a worthy enemy Read the signs: "No feeding the baboon" Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance Never let your so-called mans know your plans (How many of us have them?) A show of hands (Friends) is a term some people use loosely I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crews see You telling me; I try to act broke Jealousy the number one killer among black folk Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke Ghetto Cinderellas, lead 'em right to your stack, loc Just another way a chick'll lead to your end I check the dictionary for the meaning of friend It said: (Friend): Person, one who likes to socialize with Sympathiser, helper... and that's about the size of it Most of the time these attributes is one-sided To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch (Click!) and when things get quiet Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal Don't let it get drastic, think of how yer moms'll feel When it get for real, steel get to sparkin' Everything darken, and ain't no talkin' For somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble Ya better off focusing than tryin to plot to bubble Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is (One's we can depend on...Friends) Some come in the form of codependence A lot of times only end up being codefendants Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence And leave you up under the jail, begging for a penance It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty? Honor amongst crooks, trust amongst royalty I'd rather go out in a blaze, than give 'em the glory (How many of us have--) a similar story (Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing Just so when I let her get the man thing, she know its no strings We could do the damn thing, but ho its no rings Just how the tramp swings, will she see 'em again? That depends on how good was the skins And could she memorize the lessons It ain't no need to pretend Even though she let 'em stab it, she know they're just friends [Outro] (Friends How many of us have them? Friends Ones we can depend on? Friends How many of us have them? Friends Before we go any further) Fellas! Don't be silly! I know who my friends are! And the next nice neighborhood I move into, you guys'll get crackin' (Negro humor always escaped me.)

And I was in the session with him. I had my demo with me. You know, like I always do. I play the songs, he's like "Who that spittin?" I'm like "It's me." He's like "Oh, well okay." Uhh, he started talkin to me on the phone, going back and forth Just askin me to send him beats, and I'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers, cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with So won't you raise your glass won't you So won't you raise your glass won't you So won't you raise your glass won't you So won't you raise your glass won't you And um, he was friends with my mentor, No ID. And No ID told him, "Look man, you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap" No ID: "Yo, you wanna sign him, tell him you like how he rap" [Saxophone Solo] I was all, I dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer [Hiphop: "I'll sign you as a producer and a rapper"] I'm like oh shit. I was messin with, uh, D-Dot also. People were like this, started talking about the ghost production but that's how I got in the game. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't be here. So you know, after they picked that "Truth" beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that. I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, "Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty. And at that time, like the drums really weren't soundin right to me So I went and um, I was listening to Dre Chronic 2001 at that time.And really I just, like bit the drums off "Explosive" and put it like with it sped up, sampled, and now it's kind of like my whole style, when it started, when he rapped on "This Can't be Life." And that was like, really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album. I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know, I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management. I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I, I just needed some fresh air, you know what I'm sayin cause I been there for a while. I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level. And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet Jay-Z and he said, "Oh you a real soulful dude." [Jay-Z: "Oh you a real soulful dude, man"] And he, uh, played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it, one take. And he said [Jay-Z: "Check this out, tell me what you think of this, right here"] "Tell me what you think of this." And I heard it, and I was thinking like, man, I really wanted more like of the simple type Jay-Z. I ain't want like the, the more introspective, complicated rhy- or the... in my personal opinion. So he asked me, "What you think of it?" [Jay-Z: "so what you think of this?"] And I was like, "Man that shit tight," you know what I'm sayin', man what I'ma tell him? I was on the train, man, you know. So after that I went back home. And man I'm, I'm just in Chicago, I'm trying to do my thing. You know, I got groups. I got acts I'm trying to get on, and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been. One of my homies that was one of my artists, he got signed. But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk. Me and my mother drove to... [Mother: "Come on, let's just go"] ...Newark, New Jersey. I hadn't even seen my apartment. I remember I pulled up... [Mother: "Kanye, baby, we're here"] ...I unpacked all my shit. You know, we went to Ikea, I bought a bed, I put the bed together myself. I loaded up all my equipment, and the first beat I made was, uh, "Heart of the City." And Beans was still working on his album at that time, so I came up there to Baseline, it was Beans' birthday, matter of fact, and I played like seven beats. And, you know I guess he was in the zone, he already had the beats that he wanted, I had did "Nothing Like It" already at that time but then Jay walked in. I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on. I remember it like, like it was yesterday. And Hiphop said, "Yo play that one beat for him." And I played "Heart of the City." And really I made "Heart of the City," I really wanted to give that beat To DMX [Hiphop: "No I think Jay gon' like this one right here"] And I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, "Yo what's up I'm Kanye." [Dame: "Yo, you that kid, Kanye?"] "You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics" [Dame: "Jay got classics, G."] You know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like "oh shit." And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, "yo Jay I could rap." And I spit this rap that said, uh "I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips." And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said "man that was tight." [Jay-Z: "That, that was cool. That was hot."] That was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, "H to the Izzo," my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. "Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z." You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, "yo but I rap too." Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here. I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say "naw." Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man... [Jessica: "Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real."] I'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up ["Y'all niggas is stupid"] Let's just say I didn't get my deal. The nigga that was behind me, I mean, he wasn't even a nigga, you know? The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe 3H from Capitol Records. He wanted to sign me really bad [Joe: "We gonna change the game, buddy."] Dame was like, "Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack." [Dame: "You gotta make sure it's not wack."] Then one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.' Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him, and he's like "oh shit" [Dame: "Oh shit it's not even wack."] "I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot." [Dame: "it's actually kinda hot."] Like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like "yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick" [Dame: "you don't wanna catch a brick"] "You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on." I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, "oh, word?" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, "oh he's just a producer rapper" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, "yo... Capitol pulled on the deal" [Mel: "Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal."] And, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, "man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?" So won't you raise your glass, won't you... So won't you raise your glass, won't you... So won't you raise your glass, won't you... So won't you raise your glass, won't you...

Eminem|The Marshall Mathers LP|I'm Back|[Hook] That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back) I'm back (I'm back) I'm back (Slim Shady) [Verse 1] I murder a rhyme, one word at a time You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine You better get rid of that 9, it ain't gonna help What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself? I'm waiting for Hell, like hell, shit, I'm anxious as hell Manson, you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf I used to get punked and bullied on my block 'Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox I used to give a fuck, now I could give a fuck less What do I think of success? It sucks, too much press I'm stressed, too much cess, depressed, too upset It's just too much mess, I guess I must just blew up quick (yes) Grew up quick (no) was raised right Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right You think of my name now whenever you say hi Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I- -T-E, ‘cause MTV was so friendly to me Can't wait 'til Kim sees me Now, is it worth it? Look at my life, how is it perfect? Read my lips, bitch! What, my mouth isn't workin'? You hear this finger?

My name is Slim Shady I been crazy way before radio didn't play me The sensational {??*vocal scratch "Back is the incredible!"*}?? With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible It's Ken Kaniff on the Internet Tryin' to lure your kids with him into bed It's a sick world we live in these days "Slim, for pete's sakes, put down Christopher Reeve's legs!" Geez, you guys are so sensitive "Slim, it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it" Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic Whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smoke in 'em With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented Doing lines of coke in 'em With a bunch of guys hopping out, all high and indo scented And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me [Hook] That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back) I'm back (I'm back) I'm back (Slim Shady) [Verse 3: Eminem] I take seven [kids] from [Columbine], stand 'em all in line Add an AK-47, a revolver, a 9 A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time ‘Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy As the world was over this whole Y2K thing And by the way, N'Sync, why do they sing? Am I the only one who realizes they stink? Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings? It's why I tend to block out when I hear things ‘Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHH) So I just throw up a middle finger and let it linger Longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina ‘Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy, you know this I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck If this chick was my own mother I'd still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her And have a son and a new brother at the same time And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name? [Hook] That's why they call me Slim Shady (I'm back) I'm back (I'm back) I'm back (Slim Shady) [Eminem {??*vocal scratching*}??] Guess who's b-back, back Gue-gue-guess who's back (hi, mom) {??*scratch*}??

Well, we're in limbo too Contact the dead to get advice from Ann Landers Transmit personal problems like head lice in bandanas The big man on campus has delusions of grandeur Doing a thesis on ebonics, unconsciously using poor grammar Your mannerisms are suitable to cancer victims How much opposition does it take for your stance or position To dance to this rhythm? (you're jignorant, baby) Dance to this rhythm (go ahead, baby) Ah, forget it; it's actually accepted for rappers to have no ethics Their albums would benefit if they put in half the effort I attended candlelight vigils for Matthew Sheppard While you put out another "fuck you, faggot" record [Hook] [Verse 2 - Sage Francis] I blame my hate mail on typographical errors, correct the misspellings And then send out "thank you" notes for the love letters Accept rejection when I get a return to sender Reject acceptance when the girl's got an agenda I've entered this brave new world of true cowards Talking about, "no one goes to shows no more, they're too crowded" So they stay home and burn shit, then they say "I downloaded your life off the net, totally worth it" It's 2000, time to stop acting like assholes It ain't about backpackers or cash flow Fashionable afros, salon-style dreads or frat clothes And it ain't about these fucking loud mouths shouting "battle!" African medallions didn't sell platinum albums That's part of the reason why you think hip-hop died It was here before you were. It'll be here in the future Life's not a bitch, she's just sick of being personified That Ain't Right [hook] [Verse 3 - Sage Francis] This household is filled with the half-deads They've got a mouthful of pills because they're crack heads They shout that I'm ill, but they're doubtful of skill With the type of stabbing that turns my back red I don't blast lead, I write until my pen explodes All over fashion dreads and your Ecko clothes I don't listen when they say "shit ain't ever gonna change" And they say I ain't got no soul

Immortal Technique|The 3rd World|The 3rd World|[Verse 1] I’m from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth Right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed From where police brutality's not half as nice It makes the hood in America look like paradise Compared to the AIDS infested Caribbean slum African streets where the passport's an American gun From where they massacre people and try to keep it quiet And spend the next 25 years tryna deny it I’m from where they cut your hands off if you make a fist And niggas grow coca cause the job market doesn’t exist Except slave labour modern day company store And peacekeepers don’t ever ever ever come here no more From where the bombs that they used to drop on Vietnam Still has children born deformed 8 months before they gone I’m from where they lost the true meaning of the Koran Cause heroin is not compatible with Islam And niggas know that but grow that poppy seed anyway Cause that food drop parachute does not come every day I’m from where people pray to the gods of they conquerors And practically every president's a money launderer From where the only place democracy's acceptable If America's candidate is electable And they might even have a black president but he’s useless Cause he does not control the economy stupid! [Hook] Lock and load your gun where I'm from the 3rd World son Been to many places but I’m 3rd World born Guerrillas hit and run where I'm from the 3rd World son You polluted everything and now the 3rd World’s gone The water is poison where I'm from the 3rd World son 700 children died by the end of this song Revolution'll come where I'm from the 3rd World son Constant occupation leaves the 3rd World torn [Verse 2] I’m from where the Catholic church is some racist shit They helped Europe and America rape this bitch They pray to white Spanish Jesus who’s face is this? But never talk about the black pope Gelasius I’m from where Soviet weapons still decide elections Militaries like the Mafia you pay for protection Catamite sex tours is what the country sells And rich white businessmen make the best clientèle I’m from where they too pussy to come film Survivor And they murder Coca-Cola union organisers I’m from where the justice system esta podrido Fuck government niggas politic over perico Rebelde conocido, enterado vivo Como otro Argentino desaparecido Cause RICO laws don’t apply to the CIA And motherfuckers make sneakers for a quarter a day I’m from where they overthrow Democratic leaders Not for the people but for the Wall Street Journal readers From where blacks, indigenous peoples and Asians Were once slaves of the Caucasians And it’s amazing how they trained them To be racist against themselves in the place they was raised in You kept us caged in Destroyed our culture and said that you civilised us Raped our women and when we were born, you despised us Gentrified us, agent provocateur divide us And crucified every revolutionary messiah So I'm a start a global riot That not even your fake anti-Communist dictators can keep quiet Fuck your charity medicine tryna to murder me The immunisations you gave us were full of mercury So now I see the 3rd World like the rap game soldier Nationalise the industry and take it over [Hook]

Lit it up like the Fourth of July Because I float like a butterfly, sting like a bee No, I'm the E of EPMD I have a strong point of view on the way things run Just shut up and listen and learn my son [PMD] Absorb that ass like Bounty, the quicker picker upper To tell you up front, you're nothing but a sucker The style we're using, no doubt copastetic You try to bite and yet sound pathetic Cause I'mma rhyme like a tailor, flow like a sailor As the beat gets stronger, MC's get staler Not bragging or protagging, surely not fagging MC's surrender, raise the flags and Give up the titles because the signs are vital I keep a voice tuned at a slow and swift idle You a customer [Erick Sermon] I need a man meal sandwich, yes I need Manwich I feel good, now it's time to do damage I flow like Bounty, you know what I mean?

If you can, I'll slap your hand and give you credit And if not, I'll turn around and say "Forget it" [Erick Sermon] People say that I'm a party pooper To tell the truth I'm a born trooper You a customer

I go blaow It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul I might have took your first child Scarred your life, or crippled your style I gave you power, I made you buck-wild How you like me now?

He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong Knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase My owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast I didn't know he was hit, it's over with Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me Damn

Sage Francis|The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War|Makeshift Patriot|[Intro] I’ve heard enough of you young fellas, who think you know it all You know nothing, you have not seen a shot fired And you’re waving the damn flag Frank, what’s up man? Watchin' some bullshit, on the news Fuckin' bullshit. Reporters, tryin' to win a fuckin' Emmy [Hook] Makeshift patriot The flag shop is out of stock I hang myself at half-mast Makeshift patriot The flag shop is out of stock I hang myself via live telecast Coming live from my own funeral The beautiful weather offered a nice shine Which is suitable for a full view of a forever-altered skyline It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence My journalistic ethics slip when I pass them off as objective: "Don't gimme that ethical shit." I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable American kids And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is That's exactly what they attacked when a typically dark-skinned Disney villain Used civilians against civilians and charged the Trojan horses into our buildings Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction Pregnant women couldn't protect their children Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions Now I have to backpedal from the shower of glass and metal Wondering how after it settles we'll find who provided power to radical rebels The Melting Pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over But only on our own soil so the little boy holds a toy soldier And waits for the suit and tie to come home. We won't wait till he's older Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end "Now get a close up of his head" [Hook] Makeshift patriot The flag shop is out of stock I hang myself at half-mast Makeshift patriot The flag shop is out of stock I hang myself while the stock markets crash The city is covered in inches of muck I see some other pictures of victims are up Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck Leaping lovers are making decisions to jump! While holding hands, to escape the brutal heat Sometimes in groups of the three The fallout goes far beyond the toxic cloud where people look like debris But all they saw after all was said, beyond the talking heads Was bloody dust with legs looking like the walking dead calling for meds Hospitals are overwhelmed. Volunteers need to go the hell home Moments of silence for fire fighters were interupted by cell phones Who's going to make that call to increase an unknown death toll? It's the one we rally behind He's got a megaphone, and he's promising to make heads roll So we cheer him on, but asbestos is affecting our breath control The less we know, the more they fabricate. The easier it is to sell souls Talking Interlude: "There is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last Changes need to be made: No more curbside baggage 7PM curfew Racial profiling will continue with less bitching We’ve unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote, remember; our God is bigger, stronger, smarter and much wealthier So wave those flags with pride, especially the white part" We sell addictive 24-hour candlelight vigil in TVs Freedom will be defended at the cost of civil liberties Viewers are glued to television screens Stuck, cause lots of things seem too sick I use opportunities to pluck heart strings for theme music I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at, and what foot is right to kiss We don't know who the culprit is yet, but he looks like this We know who the heros are. Not the xenophobes who act hard "We taught that dog to squat How dare he do that shit in our own back yard!" They happened to scar our financial state and char our landscape Can you count how many times so far I ran back this same damn tape? While a cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats on the West Bank With a ten-second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle Because even if we win this tug of war and even the score, humanity struggles There's a desperate need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble Some of them dug for answers in the mess, but the rest were looking for trouble [Hook] Makeshift patriot The flag shop is out of stock I hang myself at half-mast Makeshift patriot The flag shop is out of stock I hang myself, don't waive your rights with your flags

That's what he used to say Flesh is a trap. And magic sets us free." [Verse 1: Ikon the Verbal Hologram] The War of Gods and Men I condemn them who believe In ancient fallacies and the heresy of thieves Burn the unholy in your filthy religion Paganism and the prism of three-dimensional prison I walk through the liquid of the Seven Rivers And deliver rhyme schemes that cut like verbal scissors Or arrows The sacred science of the pharaohs Millennium prophesies of tarots Murdered cattle, discovered near the crop circles of the land While we fight wars for political whores like Mary Magdalan The Hologram plans his incision Apparition of Tibetan black magicians My compositions will turn men into slaves Holographic aspects of particles and waves Propel the spacecraft in the Pleiades Dwell in the abyssal plains like the Horse of Hades The Wheel of Infinity, the Chamber of the Trinity Levitators of the fifth level magician of divinity Like a pentadrone, I sent your dome into the forest Of Ibilis Like the wilderness of Tan The Verbal Hologram!
