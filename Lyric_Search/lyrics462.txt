Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life So now I'm down for whatever ain't nothing nice Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly But now this higher learning got the Remy in me Liquor's invaded my kidneys Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me I can't be held accountable, D'evils beating me down, boo Got me running with guys making G's, telling lies that sound true Come test me, I never cower For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils [Hook]

Jay Z|The Black Album|December 4th|[Produced by Just Blaze] [Intro: Gloria Carter] Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child [Verse 1: Jay Z] They say "They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone" So on that note, I'm leaving after the song So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnes Reeves Who made love under the sycamore tree Which makes me a more sicker MC And my momma would claim At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain Although through the years I gave her her fair share I gave her her first real scare I made up for birth when I got here She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care But I feel worthless ‘cause my shirts wasn't matching my gear Now I'm just scratching the surface ‘Cause what's buried under there Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted But I had demons deep inside That would raise when confronted [Interlude: Gloria Carter] Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up [Verse 2: Jay Z] Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me And my momma couldn't beat me Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me So, with that disdain in my membrane Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came Then DeHaven introduced me to the game Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine; I'm a hustler now My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd And all the wavy light-skinned girls is loving me now My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had Supposedly, knowing nobody paid Jaz wack ass I'm getting ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap But that came second to me movin' this crack "Gimme a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career Till '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye! [Interlude: Gloria Carter] Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble [Verse 3: Jay Z] Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush Your blood boils you in the spot, knowing cops could rush And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch No two days are alike Except the first and fifteenth, pretty much And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up And the drought will define a man when the well dries up You learn the worth of water without work You thirst 'til you die, yup! And niggas get tied up for product And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up To show mothers they really got 'em And this was the stress I lived with 'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven For every bad decision I made, every sister I played ‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me [Outro: Jay Z] If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black

"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!" I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off [Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh?

[Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady [Verse 3] Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (GET 'EM!) Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate! I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive Am I coming or going? I can barely decide I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? All my life I was very deprived I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits! I lay awake and strap myself in the bed Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had [Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Jay Z|The Blueprint|Renegade|[Verse 1: Jay Z] Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it? See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doin' What I do, through and through, and I give you the news with a twist It's just his ghetto point of view The renegade, you been afraid, I penetrate pop culture Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters From botched robberies, niggas crouched over Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over Knocked down by some clown When child support knocked; no, he's not around Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down I bring it through the ghetto without riding round Hiding down, ducking strays From frustrated youths stuck in they ways Just read a magazine that fucked up my day How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it? I help them see they way through it – not you Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes Bet everything you're worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt [Verse 2: Eminem] Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute ‘Cause, see, they call me a menace And if the shoe fits I'll wear it But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it Now, who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics? Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits? But there's a huge interference They're saying you shouldn't hear it Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish But I'm debated, disputed, hated And viewed in America as a motherfuckin' drug addict Like you didn't experiment, nah nah That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents You fucking do-gooders Too bad you couldn't do good at marriage And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here? I don't think you do So stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo ‘Cause here we go, he's {​*Jigga j-Jigga*}​ And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass, it's just a… [Hook: Eminem + Jay Z] Renegade!

Never been afraid to say What's on my mind at any given time of day ‘Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to holler About anything, anything, anything, anything! [Verse 3: Jay Z] I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in By the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver Durag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty An orphan my pops left me And often, my mamma wasn't home Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown Especially on nights I brought something home To quiet the stomach rumblings My demeanor, 30 years my senior My childhood didn't mean much, only raising green up Raising my fingers to critics Raising my head to the sky, B.I.G. I did it, multi before I die No lie, just know I chose my own fate I drove by the fork in the road and went straight [Verse 4: Eminem] See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape? Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today See, it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter making this butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'… [Hook: Eminem + Jay Z] Renegade!

Eminem|Encore|Yellow Brick Road|[Intro] "What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children." "We seem to be approaching an age of the gross." {burp} "We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' nation and each generation should do a little bit better." [Verse 1] Alright, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough Let's get it started Let's start addressing this issue and open it up Let's take this shit back to the basement And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love The music that we all enjoy The music you accuse me of trying to destroy Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy On the east side of Detroit Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory I'd like to share a story This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me You have well-informed me I am well aware that I don't belong here You've made that perfectly clear I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there From the black side all the way to the white side Okay, there's a bright side: a day that I might slide You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks Them good old notorious so well-known tracks [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home [Verse 2] I'd roam the streets so much they call me a drifter Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke And steal a goddamn bike from somebody's backyard And drop it off at the park, that was the halfway mark To meet Kim, had to walk Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my Mom's That's about the time I first met Proof With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osbourne Handing out some flyers He was doing some talent shows at Center Line High I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime He looked at me like I'm out my mind Shook his head, like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme." I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place" And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit With compound syllables sound combined From that day we was down to ride Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home [Verse 3] My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through And said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew Must've been true because, man, we done banned they shoes I had the new ones, the Cool J, Ice Lamb, suede too But we just threw them in the trash, like they yesterday's news Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted, Professor X (vanglorious) Exists in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies! Now with this being a new trend, we don't fit in Crackas is out with Cactus albums, blackness is in African symbols and medallions Represent Black Power, and we ain't know what it meant Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall With 'em all over our necks like we're showin 'em off Not knowing at all, we was being laughed at "You ain't even half black! You ain't supposed to have that, homie, let me grab that! And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!" All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement Saying how we hate this How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is Which reminds me, back in '89, me and Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryna two-time me And there was this black girl at our school Who thought I was cool ‘cause I rapped So she was kinda eyeing me And oh the irony, guess what her name was? Ain't even goin' say it, plus, the same color hair as hers Was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her But she dumped me for this black guy And that's the last I ever seen or heard Or spoke to the "Oh Foolish Pride" girl But I've heard people say they heard the tape And it ain't that bad – but it was, I singled out a whole race And for that I apologize, I was wrong ‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a ho [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home

Sending the troops in the war so I turn it To today's evening news And the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow) As the world keeps turning slow (turning slow, turning slow) As the world keeps on turning slow (turning slow, turning slow) This is your evening news [Verse 2] I know you take offense to certain words I've heard worse, but I wouldn't blame ya' They say he's a entertainer, don't worry about it, never mind Kramer The Crocodile Hunter got stung, and the lion turned on the lion tamer We keep sending troops to Iraq, I figured that we must like danger Little kids don't learn in school they go to school to go spray a gun If you a parent, then be a parent, get off the couch and go raise your son Kobe just broke another record, today's game he hit 81 Now they saying he's number 1, but yesterday they all hated him OJ was named innocent, he got no sentence, he's still alive It's very ironic that the lawyer that defended him had to die Well, now my cue card says the price of gas isn't really high But I'm not going to read that, cause we all know that that's a lie [Hook] [Verse 3] We still haven't found Pac's killer, still haven't found Biggie's either 30 minutes into the case they got tired and took a breather Snoop Dogg just got arrested, everyday he gets a new subpoena Innocent when murder was the case so the prosecution got a middle finger Hip-Hop is sweeping the nation, but the contents seem so degrading Most rappers got new albums that white kids are anticipating If you don't like it on the radio or the television then switch the station Flavor Flav get a lot of ratings, Bill O'Reilly somewhere is hating Kanye just said WHAT? the president ain't got time for that The White House is going to stay white even tho' we know Obama's black 9/11 was a calculation, and some would say it was a timed attack He gave a speech on CNN, "They bombed us, now we're bombing back" Where the heck is Osama at? And I would love to talk about Katrina But every time I talk about Katrina they look at me like its a misdemeanor Anyways there’s way more important stuff that we can discuss Nsync, Making the Band, and Milli Vanilli have broken up [Hook]

If the shit is lies, god strike me and I got a question Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice [Hook] Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own (So where you from?)

It's war on the streets and a war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do But now I'm back with the facts giving it back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimp-smack you up You gotta learn to hold your own They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone But tell the cops they can't touch this I don't trust this, when they try to rush I bust this That's the sound of my tool You say it ain't cool, my mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back ‘Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback Some buck that I roughed up way back Coming back after all these years "Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat!" That's the way it is [Hook: Talent] That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah (You're my brother, you're my sister) That's just the way it is Things'll never be the same That's just the way it is Aww yeah [Outro: 2Pac] Some things'll never change

Bob Dylan|Bringing It All Back Home|Subterranean Homesick Blues|[Verse 1] Johnny's in the basement, mixing up the medicine I'm on the pavement, thinking about the government The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off Look out kid, it's something you did God knows when, but you're doing it again You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend The man in the coon-skin cap in the pig pen Wants 11 dollar bills - you only got 10 [Verse 2] Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot Talking that the heat put plants in the bet book Phone's tapped anyway Maggie says "The Man, he say" They must bust in early May, "Orders from the D.A."

Ice Cube|The Predator|It Was a Good Day|[Produced by DJ Pooh] [Verse 1] Just waking up in the morning, gotta thank God I don't know, but today seems kinda odd No barking from the dog, no smog And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog I got my grub on, but didn't pig out Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out Hooked it up for later as I hit the door Thinking, "Will I live another 24?" I gotta go, ‘cause I got me a drop-top And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop Had to stop at a red light Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight And everything is alright I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all "Which park are y'all playing basketball?" Get me on the court and I'm trouble Last week, fucked around and got a triple double Freaking niggas every way, like MJ I can't believe today was a good day [Verse 2] Drove to the pad and hit the showers Didn't even get no static from the cowards ‘Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me Saw the police and they rolled right past me No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction As I ran the intersection Went to Short Dog's house, they was watching Yo! MTV Raps What's the haps on the craps? Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em Roll 'em in a circle of niggas And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11 7, even back door Lil Joe I picked up the cash flow Then we played bones, and I'm yelling, "Domino!" Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A Today was a good day [Verse 3] Left my nigga's house paid Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic The Lakers beat the Supersonics I felt on the big fat fanny Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani And my dick runs deep, so deep So deep put her ass to sleep Woke her up around one She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin' Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion I was glad everything had worked out Dropped her ass off and then chirped out Today was like one of those fly dreams Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams No helicopter looking for a murder 2 in the morning, got the Fatburger Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp And it read "Ice Cube's a Pimp" Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up Half way home and my pager still blowin' up Today I didn't even have to use my AK I got to say it was a good day [Outro] Hey, wait, wait a minute!

But he wasn't talking about coke and birds It was more like spoken word Except he's really putting it down? And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory And what we need to do in the game Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed If you could feel how my face felt You would know how Mase felt Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt I swear to God, Driver 2 wants to sue I got a lawyer for the case to keep what's in my safe safe My dawgs couldn't tell if I... I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky It was televised There's been an accident like GEICO They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass? Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past Toys "R" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid Swear I should be locked up for stupid shit that I did But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire [Hook/Outro] Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall (Y'know what I'm saying?)

Through the fire ("It's bad enough I got all this jewelry on!") Through whatever, come what may For a chance at loving you (She can't be serious, man) I'd take it all the way Right down to the wire Even through the fire To the limit Through the fire To the limit Through the fire To the limit Through the fire To the limit

Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say? [Verse 1: Ice Cube] Fuck the police! Comin' straight from the underground A young nigga got it bad ‘cause I'm brown And not the other color, so police think They have the authority to kill a minority Fuck that shit, ‘cause I ain't the one For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun To be beating on, and thrown in jail We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell Fuckin' with me ‘cause I'm a teenager With a little bit of gold and a pager Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics You'd rather see me in the pen Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o Beat a police out of shape And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape To tape off the scene of the slaughter Still getting swoll off bread and water I don't know if they fags or what Search a nigga down, and grabbing his nuts And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none But don't let it be a black and a white one ‘Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top Black police showing out for the white cop Ice Cube will swarm On any motherfucker in a blue uniform Just ‘cause I'm from the CPT Punk police are afraid of me Huh, a young nigga on the warpath And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath Of cops, dying in L.A Yo, Dre, I got something to say [Hook] Fuck tha police!

MC Ren, will you please give your testimony To the jury about this fucked up incident? [Verse 2: MC Ren] Fuck the police! And Ren said it with authority Because the niggas on the street is a majority A gang is with whoever I'm steppin' And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in A stash box, for the so-called law Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw Lights start flashing behind me But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me But that shit don't work, I just laugh Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path For police, I'm saying, "Fuck you, punk!" Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk Pulling out a silly club, so you stand With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand But take off the gun so you can see what's up And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up! Make you think I'ma kick your ass But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime But I'ma smoke them now and not next time Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me Or any asshole that threatens me I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope Taking out a cop or two, they can't cope with me The motherfuckin' villain that's mad With potential to get bad as fuck So I'ma turn it around Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (Gunshot sounds) Yeah, somethin' like that But it all depends on the size of the gat Taking out a police would make my day But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say… [Hook] Fuck tha police!

Just shut the fuck up And get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!) But I didn't do shit Man, just shut the fuck up! Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit? [Verse 3: Eazy-E & MC Ren] I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin' Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and Shining the light in my face, and for what? Maybe it's because I kick so much butt I kick ass, or maybe ‘cause I blast On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger Of an Uzi or an AK ‘Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say They put out my picture with silence ‘Cause my identity by itself causes violence The E with the criminal behavior Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still I got flavor Without a gun and a badge, what do you got? A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot By me, or another nigga And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger (Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool!) And as you all know, E's here to rule Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a Dumb motherfucker with a gun And if I'm rollin' off the 8, he'll be the one That I take out, and then get away While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say [Hook] Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police! [Skit 3: Dr. Dre, Cop The verdict: The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck White bread, chickenshit motherfucker Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie! Get him out of here! I want justice! Get him the fuck out my face! I want justice! Out, right now! Fuck you, you black motherfuckers! [Hook] Fuck tha police! Fuck tha police!

Jay Z|Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life|A Week Ago|[Intro: Jay Z] It was all good just a week ago Had this all good just a week ago [Interlude: Too $hort] Last week I had everything. I had the money, had the cars, the bitches, and the jewelry. And then my motherfucking nigga started snitching. Beyotch! [Verse 1: Jay Z] Growing up in the hood, just my dog and me We used to hustle in the hood for all to see Problems; I called on him, he called on me We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P Let him unlock doors off my keys Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly The feds came to get me, we both fled quickly Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change And when he called collect and I heard his name I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone He's talking reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone I said: "Damn, dog! What, 9 weeks and you're home?" He said: "Main man, you think shit's sweet ‘Cause you're home." I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone The crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin' I said: "The world don't stop, I've got to keep-keep on." From there I sensed the beef was on I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced And they show the other side When they catch a new case; it's on [Hook: Too $hort + Jay Z] It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks I don't see how this side of you could be provoked Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what seven days can change A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names It was all good just a week ago [Verse 2: Jay Z] Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell We both came in this game, blind as hell I did a little better, had more clientele Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail Seventeen and I'm holding on to around a mill' I could bail out and blow trial and come around on appeal Had niggas thinking I was from uptown for real I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30 Freezing on them corners, still holding my crack Looking up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?? Came from flat broke to letting the dough stack You tell them feds I said: "I'm never going back." I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious [Hook: Too $hort + Jay Z] It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks I don't see how this side of you could be provoked Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what seven days can change A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names It was all good just a week ago [Verse 3: Jay Z] The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things All this after a week in the bing I'm mad at myself, ‘cause I didn't spot the weakling I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that? Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry That's right, the same game That make you math could make you die It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat? Now, you know that's bad when your sister is mad And your son gotta grow up, like, "This is my dad?" The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars [Hook: Too $hort + Jay Z] It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks I don't see how this side of you could be provoked Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago Funny what seven days can change A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names It was all good just a week ago [Outro: Too Short] Shit is crazy, man. All these niggas out here snitchin'. We was one step away from taking this crack money, and recycling it through the ghettoes, and building back up our own hoods. Now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other. I got partners doing 15–20. Wouldn't have been doing SHIT if you didn't snitch. Beyotch! It's about time y'all check that shit out, man. It ain't all good, shut your mouth, just watch the game, and don't snitch. It sure will do a lot for you. Believe that, baby. Jay Z, Short Dawg's in the house, mane. You know I got it, got it going on. We got the money. Ain't got nothing to do with crime, baby. But I'm recognizing… [Interlude: Jay Z] You rat bastard!

The Roots|Game Theory|Don't Feel Right|[Hook - Maimouna Youssef] It don't feel right, it don't feel right Don't feel it, don't feel it, can't feel it no more Things don't feel right over here Lately I ain't been seeing it clear Seems to me nowadays things have changed I don't know if I feel the same [Verse 1-Black Thought] Yo, in the land of the unseen hand that holds trouble Theorize your game, it's difficult to roll a double The struggle ain't right up in ya face, it's more subtle But it's still coming across like the bridge and tunnel vision I try to school these bucks, but they don't wanna listen That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit Where the dope slangin' keep swangin' like Sonny Liston The money missing and there's mouths to feed Get the brain kicking, thinking of a thousand things Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid? When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air Was it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear? Something don't feel right out here [Hook] [Verse 2] Look, my eyes open cause I'm really a watchman And when I'm writing my thoughts out, really I'm boxing My main adversary any silly concoction Freeze your face like botulinum toxin If you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton The Jones, the Richardsons, the Smiths and the Johnsons If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice It should play with your conscience, do away with the nonsense I'm overseeing anything within my circumference This ain't a press junket, I ain't seeking responses I stand where the people got the heat in they pockets You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit If you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted If it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'? [Hook] [Verse 3] Yo, children working, weapon producing Natural disaster got the planet in a panic We all got to make that living Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion Forms of hustling, watch who you put all your trust in Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering Who never had shit and ain't got nothing But more struggling, it makes you wanna run up in the motherfuckin' Hot zone for a piece of the cake back I can't work for it, I can certainly take that I'm fired up, thinking about the payback, ASAP You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black Ill, but that's too real for TV It's crazy when you too real to be free If you don't got no paper, then steal this CD Listen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me [Hook]

2Pac|Until the End of Time|Letter To My Unborn Child|[Intro] To my unborn child… To my unborn child In case I don’t make it Just remember, Daddy loves you [Verse 1] Now ever since my birth I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile In case I never get to holla at my unborn child Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin' Trying to earn every penny that I'm gettin', I'm reminiscin' To the beginning of my mission When I was conceived and came to be in this position My momma was a Panther: loud single parent, but she proud When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house ‘Cause my mama say I'm good for nothing, so I'm out Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again My only friend is my misery Wanting revenge for the agony they did to me See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure getting better Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child [Hook: Natasha Walker] I'm writing you a letter This is to my unborn child Want to let you know I love you If you didn't know I feel this way ‘Cause I think about you every day I have so much to say [Verse 2] Seems so complicated to escape fate And you can never understand till we trade places Tell the world I feel guilty for being anxious Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist It's hard to face this cold world on a good day When will they let the little kids in the hood play? I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin' Living proof there's a God if you need a reason Can I believe in my own fate? Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way? Dear Mama, I'm a man now I wanna make it on my own, not a handout Make way for a whirlwind prophesized I wanna go in peace when I got to die On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child [Hook] [Verse 3] Dear Lord, can you hear me? Tell me what to say To my unborn seed in case I pass away Will my child get to feel love? Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs? ‘Cause being black hurts, and even worse if you speak first Living my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse? ‘Cause maybe if I tried to change Who'm I kidding? I'm a thug til I die; I'm a rider, mane Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places Regular criminal oasis awaits us If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there And I'm sorry for not being there Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World Bless the boys and all my little girls To the Lord: I'm eternal, resting in peace Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child [Outro] Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child To my unborn child… This letter goes out to my seeds that I might not get to see ‘cause of this lifestyle Just know your daddy loved you Got nothing but love for you And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had ‘Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind When you get to be my age, you’ll understand Just know I got love for you And I’ll see you if there’s a ghetto in Heaven If there’s a ghetto Heaven, I’ll be there waiting for you Heh heh, take care. Run wild, but be smart Follow the rules of the game I know sometimes there’s confusion Rules of the game is gonna get you through it All day every day Watch out for these snakes and fakes Friends come a dime a dozen Be an individual, work hard Study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody

Boots] City lights from far away can make you drop your jaw Sparklin' like sequins on a transvestite at Mardi Gras There's beauty in the cracks of the cement When I was five I hopped over them wherever we went to prevent Whatever it was that could break my momma's back Little did I know that it would roll up in a Cadillac And matter-of-fact, she couldn't see him like a cataract And on the track, she went from beautiful to battle axe And back at home, she would cry into her pillow Vomit in the commode, I was six years old I would crawl onto her lap and we would hug and hold Never knew how she was sufferin' for my food and clothes She asked me what I thought of Jesus when he broke off some bread I said, "He's missin' an arm, and he seems like a pee-pee head" She said, don't cuss, and my teeth to go brush And get ready for bed, and the toilet to flush With tears in my momma's eyes, I was her everything Before she went out on the stroll She'd tuck me into bed and sing "You're just too beautiful for words" I see the red and white lights as the ambulance flies Reminds me of midnight in a dope fiend's eyes And my nine-year-old self as paramedics leave Left to bawl my eyes out on a neighbor's sleeve To give illustrations that are clear and clean I'll take you two hours back, before this scene Early in the morning when the sun starts to creep When the birds start to chirp and crackheads go to sleep Moms was comin' in I heard her keys go clink Wearin' nothin' but pumps, bikini, and fake mink Even though she served, for fifty dollars-a-pop Hardly had enough for rent after Jesus re-copped That day the landlady got her rent before he got his knot Slammed momma's head against the front bolt lock Then the pump with one arm done harm Reached back and plowed into her head like a farm Never saw the act, locked in the back, I was cussin' Heard the blap blap of twenty head crack percussion And body blows, her body froze from bolos to the spine I was hysterically cryin', all she could do was whine She didn't even have the strength to say, I love you Boo But I said it to her and she knew that I knew She was dead by the time the ambulance got on the case But I never will forget the plastic hand stuck in her face Stop at the intersection to ask Jesus 'bout directions Let's go to Frisco, I got very friendly vocal inflections Mob a left at MacArthur to continue in flight Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night [Hook] [Verse 3 - Boots] The rain dropped giant pearls, God was pissin' on the world Or that old man who was snorin' rolled on over and earled My temperature gauge read, cold and blistery Spinnin' wheels made each piece of asphalt history This was Jesus debut out the penitentiary Fifteen years, but it seem like a century See, he went in the pen for some other murder drama Twelve years old when I wrote him quote I wanna be a pimp, comma You accidentally killed my mom, no player hatin' points You know how bitches act, shit, exclamation points First it was a set up move, then it was the truth His letters were the only thing I had as a youth But his lopsided game, see, was really counterfeit So my little son Dominic thinks that I'm a dick Cause I was runnin' 'round like a little baby Jesus To me women had to be saints, hoes, or skeezers And I don't think that it's gonna end til we make revolution But who gonna make the shit if we worship prostitution Ain't no women finna die for the same old conclusion Put they life on the line so some other pimp could use 'em Pulled into a vacant lot, the road to recovery Pulled out my pistol as we brushed against the shrubbery Jesus said, why the hell you pointin' a gat So I pulled a piece of game I could use out the hat I said, "This trip is over, we ain't finna ride on This is for my mental and my momma that I cried on Microsoft motherfuckers let bygones be bygones But since I'm Macintosh, I'mma double click your icons" He struggled for life, then gave up the fight Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Granada last night [Hook] [Boots] And I still remember momma You're much too beautiful for words

2Pac|Tupac: Resurrection OST|Runnin' (Dying to Live)|[Intro: 2Pac and (?)] Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying? I was like, this is like a fucking election It is that (You know what I am saying) Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like… [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? (You don't know) Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die? [Verse 1 - The Notorious B.I.G.] Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up Choppin' rocks overnight. The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White We had to grow dreads to change our description Two cops is on the milk box missin' Show they toes, you know they got stepped on A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon Runnin' from the police, picture that Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack That's why I bust back, it don't phase me When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?

[Verse 2 - 2Pac] (It's on me), but still I'm having memories Of high speed when the cops crashed As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts? Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes No hesitation in extermination of these snitches Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna to screw me Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do? But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew And now media is trying to test me Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me Misery is all I see, that's my mind state My history with the police will shake the crime rate My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped He screamed "Thug Life!" and emptied the clip Got tired of runnin' from the police [Hook] And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead? Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight? Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight? Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try? Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die? [Outro - 2Pac] They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast [The Notorious B.I.G.] I was more shocked than anything, you know what I'm saying? But I wasn't more shocked of him dying I was more shocked of him... Pac is a strong dude, yo I know dude, you know what I'm saying? Real strong So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, "Again?" you know what I'm sayin'? He always getting shot, or shot at He going to pull through this one again Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over You know what I'm saying? But when he, when he died I was just like, "whoa", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by I mean even though we was going through our drama I would never wish death on nobody, you know what I'm sayin' Because there ain't no coming back from that

You must be kidding You got to change the whole box spring, I ain't bullshitting You get hit with hysteria Cause I'm a bury a big one inside your private area All hell is in your tush When Kool G.

"Rated XXX" [Verse 2] Some say that I'm nasty plus Hookers are mad because they can't outlast me Girl, you ain't too small Cause I turn your grip to one size fits all So if you're still confused when I'm screwing Let me explain to you exactly what I'm doing Exploring your body like a biologist Inventing new ways just like a scientist Tagging my name on your buns just like a printist While I'm hurting your ass just like a dentist You're so wild, I feel like I'm a zoologist Stretching your shit more than a gynecologist I'm a twist your ass to death, miss And when you piss, you'll see more stars than an astrologist G Rap is hot-blooded, freaking horny Far from corny, come and jump on me I'm not small at all, I won't break down or stall I drive your ass up the wall Nuts and everything are well in shape Only thing missin' on my dick is a cape Let's get together, honey, you never know what's next And I'm a talk like sex Rated XXX [Chorus] "Can't ya diggit, Honey?" "Rated XXX" [Verse 3] Big girls try to squash me But I think with my dick, honey, so come and brainwash me Hit the sack cause I ain't joking Cause when I start pumping shit up, I leave it smoking So you better hold on tight all right Cause my dick is a brown stick of dynamite I stick a chick and it kills her I'm probably related to Long Dong Silver But it gets gooder and gooder Every time I grab a hooker and I put her on my frankfurter Kiss your breasts to your navel and then I skip Cause the only thing I'm licking is your ass with a whip And it's a real freaky scene I'm hitting girls with their heads in a guillotine Why, certainly I'm squirting I bust a nut and get up and wipe my dick on your curtain Pushing your head to the pillow And giving more pleasure than a double-headed dildo A big ass gets me hardened But I fuck bitches with titties like Dolly Parton Time or place doesn't matter to me, sweety I'll fuck you on the "A" train while I write graffiti In a restaurant, taking you straight to heaven In a cab or the back of 7-11 Whether you're white and the music you like is rock You can come and get some hip-hop cock Consider this dick on your clitoris but never try to flex Cause I'mma talk like sex [Outro] "Talks like sex"

Can I have your attention, Mn-hmm There's just a few things that I've got to mention (Uh-huh) There's girlies out here that seem appealing But they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings I'm telling you As Rick is my name I wouldn't trust no girl unless she feels the same Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?) Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop Cause all they do is they hurt and trample Listen up close, here comes my first example Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while Plans for the future, she's having your child Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts Telling all your friends about your family thoughts One friend was drunk so he starts to act wild He tells the truth about the kid It's not your child Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk He said, "Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work" And she led him on and tried to please him She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him Treat 'em like a prostitute (Do What?) Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop Cause all they do is they hurt and trample Listen up close, here comes my second example It's your wife You buy the tramp jewels and clothes You get sentimental and bring home a rose Give her everything cause you swear she's worth it All your friends tell you, "The bitch don't deserve it" Love is blind, so there goes your wealth Until one day, you see things for yourself Came home from work early, Mr. Loverman You had a card and some candy in your right hand There's the mailman, he was short yet stout He went inside your house and didn't come back out Bust it Just a friendly stop, come on, is it? The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit? The thought alone makes your temperature boil You say to yourself, she might still be loyal You open up your door and stand in a trance You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants Came home to party At work had a hard day Look around your house and you say, "Where the hell are they?" Run upstairs up to your bedroom You look inside your room, you see something brewin' Cover your mouth because you almost choke You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat Treat 'em like a prostitute (Mm-hmm) Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop Cause all they do is they hurt and trample Listen up close, here comes my last example Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot And today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot As you open up the door she says, "Get on the floor" She wants to try things she's never tried before She takes off your drawers and works you over She calls you Twinkles And you call her Rover Next thing you know, the ho starts to ill She says, "I love you, Harold" and your name is Will That's not the half 'til you start to ride her Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her It's not yours-who can it be? I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky Treat 'em like a prostitute Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well Treat no girlie well, until you're sure of the scoop

Eminem|The Eminem Show|'Till I Collapse|[Intro: Eminem] ‘Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up But you gotta search within you And gotta find that inner strength And just pull that shit out of you And get that motivation to not give up And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse [Verse 1: Eminem] Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em ‘Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop penning 'em And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sending 'em? Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal cop killin', hip-hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're coming with me, feel it or not, you're gonna fear it Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up? Fa shizzel, my wizzel, this is the plot, listen up You bizzels forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse [Verse 2: Eminem] Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get When you real and you spit, and people are feeling your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walk around Like nothing's bothering me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney; Nate, hit me [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse [Verse 3: Eminem] Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an emcee's heart What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd how people hang on every word I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first ‘Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack, like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launching at 'em The track is on some battling raps, who want some static? ‘Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest [Hook: Nate Dogg] Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'ma rip this shit till my bone collapse [Outro: Eminem (Nate Dogg)] Until the roof (until the roof) The roof comes off (the roof comes off) Until my legs (until my legs) Give out from (underneath me) I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me
