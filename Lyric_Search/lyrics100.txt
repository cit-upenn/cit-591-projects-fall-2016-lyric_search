Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life So now I'm down for whatever ain't nothing nice Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly But now this higher learning got the Remy in me Liquor's invaded my kidneys Got me ready to lick off, mama forgive me I can't be held accountable, D'evils beating me down, boo Got me running with guys making G's, telling lies that sound true Come test me, I never cower For the love of money, son, I'm giving lead showers Stop screaming, you know the demon said it's best to die And even if Jehovah witness, bet he'll never testify, D'evils [Hook]

Jay Z|The Black Album|December 4th|[Produced by Just Blaze] [Intro: Gloria Carter] Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child [Verse 1: Jay Z] They say "They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone" So on that note, I'm leaving after the song So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnes Reeves Who made love under the sycamore tree Which makes me a more sicker MC And my momma would claim At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain Although through the years I gave her her fair share I gave her her first real scare I made up for birth when I got here She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care But I feel worthless ‘cause my shirts wasn't matching my gear Now I'm just scratching the surface ‘Cause what's buried under there Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted But I had demons deep inside That would raise when confronted [Interlude: Gloria Carter] Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up [Verse 2: Jay Z] Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me And my momma couldn't beat me Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seeing me So, with that disdain in my membrane Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came Then DeHaven introduced me to the game Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine; I'm a hustler now My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd And all the wavy light-skinned girls is loving me now My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had Supposedly, knowing nobody paid Jaz wack ass I'm getting ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap But that came second to me movin' this crack "Gimme a second, I swear," I would say about my rap career Till '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye! [Interlude: Gloria Carter] Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble [Verse 3: Jay Z] Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush Your blood boils you in the spot, knowing cops could rush And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch No two days are alike Except the first and fifteenth, pretty much And "trust" is a word you seldom hear from us Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up And the drought will define a man when the well dries up You learn the worth of water without work You thirst 'til you die, yup! And niggas get tied up for product And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up To show mothers they really got 'em And this was the stress I lived with 'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven For every bad decision I made, every sister I played ‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me [Outro: Jay Z] If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black

"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!" I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off [Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh?

[Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady [Verse 3] Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (GET 'EM!) Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate! I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive Am I coming or going? I can barely decide I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? All my life I was very deprived I ain't had a woman in years, my palms too hairy to hide Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits! I lay awake and strap myself in the bed Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head I'm steaming mad and by the way, when you see my dad Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had [Hook] Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what? My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady Hi, my name is, what? My name is, who?

Jay Z|The Blueprint|Renegade|[Verse 1: Jay Z] Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it? See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doin' What I do, through and through, and I give you the news with a twist It's just his ghetto point of view The renegade, you been afraid, I penetrate pop culture Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters From botched robberies, niggas crouched over Mami's knocked up ‘cause she wasn't watched over Knocked down by some clown When child support knocked; no, he's not around Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down I bring it through the ghetto without riding round Hiding down, ducking strays From frustrated youths stuck in they ways Just read a magazine that fucked up my day How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it? I help them see they way through it – not you Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes Bet everything you're worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt [Verse 2: Eminem] Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute ‘Cause, see, they call me a menace And if the shoe fits I'll wear it But if it don't, then y'all will swallow the truth, grin and bear it Now, who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics? Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits? But there's a huge interference They're saying you shouldn't hear it Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish But I'm debated, disputed, hated And viewed in America as a motherfuckin' drug addict Like you didn't experiment, nah nah That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents You fucking do-gooders Too bad you couldn't do good at marriage And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here? I don't think you do So stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo ‘Cause here we go, he's {?*Jigga j-Jigga*}?

Never been afraid to holler About anything, anything, anything, anything! [Verse 3: Jay Z] I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in By the bodega, iron under my coat, feeling braver Durag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty An orphan my pops left me And often, my mamma wasn't home Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown Especially on nights I brought something home To quiet the stomach rumblings My demeanor, 30 years my senior My childhood didn't mean much, only raising green up Raising my fingers to critics Raising my head to the sky, B.I.G. I did it, multi before I die No lie, just know I chose my own fate I drove by the fork in the road and went straight [Verse 4: Eminem] See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape? Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today See, it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you What did I do? I'm just a kid from the gutter making this butter off these bloodsuckers, ‘cause I'm a muh'fuckin'… [Hook: Eminem + Jay Z] Renegade!

Eminem|Encore|Yellow Brick Road|[Intro] "What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children." "We seem to be approaching an age of the gross." {burp} "We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' nation and each generation should do a little bit better." [Verse 1] Alright, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough Let's get it started Let's start addressing this issue and open it up Let's take this shit back to the basement And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love The music that we all enjoy The music you accuse me of trying to destroy Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy On the east side of Detroit Crossing 8 Mile into Warren, into hick territory I'd like to share a story This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me You have well-informed me I am well aware that I don't belong here You've made that perfectly clear I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there From the black side all the way to the white side Okay, there's a bright side: a day that I might slide You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks Them good old notorious so well-known tracks [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home [Verse 2] I'd roam the streets so much they call me a drifter Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke And steal a goddamn bike from somebody's backyard And drop it off at the park, that was the halfway mark To meet Kim, had to walk Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my Mom's That's about the time I first met Proof With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osbourne Handing out some flyers He was doing some talent shows at Center Line High I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime He looked at me like I'm out my mind Shook his head, like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme." I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place" And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit With compound syllables sound combined From that day we was down to ride Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home [Verse 3] My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through And said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew Must've been true because, man, we done banned they shoes I had the new ones, the Cool J, Ice Lamb, suede too But we just threw them in the trash, like they yesterday's news Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted, Professor X (vanglorious) Exists in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies! Now with this being a new trend, we don't fit in Crackas is out with Cactus albums, blackness is in African symbols and medallions Represent Black Power, and we ain't know what it meant Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall With 'em all over our necks like we're showin 'em off Not knowing at all, we was being laughed at "You ain't even half black! You ain't supposed to have that, homie, let me grab that! And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!" All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement Saying how we hate this How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is Which reminds me, back in '89, me and Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryna two-time me And there was this black girl at our school Who thought I was cool ‘cause I rapped So she was kinda eyeing me And oh the irony, guess what her name was? Ain't even goin' say it, plus, the same color hair as hers Was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her But she dumped me for this black guy And that's the last I ever seen or heard Or spoke to the "Oh Foolish Pride" girl But I've heard people say they heard the tape And it ain't that bad – but it was, I singled out a whole race And for that I apologize, I was wrong ‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a ho [Hook] So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road As we go on another episode Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place That I once used to call home sweet home
