Taylor Swift | album | love story | We were both young when I first saw you.I close my eyes and the flashback starts:I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air.See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns.See you make your way through the crowdAnd say, "Hello."Little did I know...That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."And I was crying on the staircaseBegging you, "Please don't go."And I said...Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess,It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".So I sneak out to the garden to see you.We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knewSo close your eyes,Escape this town for a little while.Oh, oh.'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter,And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet."But you were everything to me,I was begging you, "Please don't go."And I said...Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone.I'll be waiting; all that's left to do is run.You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess.It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".Romeo, save me. They're trying to tell me how to feel.This love is difficult but it's real.Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess.It's a love story, baby, just say "Yes".Oh, oh, oh.I got tired of waitingWondering if you were ever coming around.My faith in you was fadingWhen I met you on the outskirts of town.And I said...

Jay-Z | BluePrint3 | Young Forever | [Mr. Hudson]Let’s dance in style,Let’s dance for a while,Heaven can wait we’re only watching the skiesHoping for the best but expecting the worst,Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?Let us die young or let us live forever,We don’t have the power but we never say never,Sitting in a sandpit,Life is a short trip,The music’s for the sad man,[Chorus]Forever young,I wanna be forever youngDo you really want to live forever?Forever and everForever young I wanna beForever youngDo you really want to live forever?Forever, forever[Jay-Z]So we live a life like a videoWhen the sun is always out and you never get oldAnd the champagne’s always coldAnd the music is always goodAnd the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hoodAnd they hop their pretty ass up on the hood of dat pretty ass carWithout a wrinkle in todayCuz there is no tomorrowJust some picture perfect dayTo last a whole lifetimeAnd it never endsCos all we have to do is hit rewindSo lets just stay in the moment, smoke some weed,Drink some wine,Reminisce talk some shit forever young is in your mindLeave a mark that can’t erase neither space nor timeSo when the director yells cut,I’ll be fine,I’m forever young...[Chorus][Jay-Z]Fear not when, fear not why,Fear not much while were alive,Life is for living not living up tight,See ya somewhere up in the sky,Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye bye,So not for legends, I'm forever youngMy name shall surviveThrough the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves,Over Pyrex pots, my name shall be passed down to generationsWhile debating up in barber shops, young slung, hung here,Shorty, the nigga from hereWith a little ambition just what we can become here,And as the father passed his story down to his sons ears,Younger kid, younger every year, yeahSo if you love me baby this is how you let me know.Don’t ever let me go, thats how you let me know, baby,[Chorus]
