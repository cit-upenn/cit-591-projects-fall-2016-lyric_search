Hi. This is a test document.

Testing creating branches and merging branches.

Useful commands--

git branch -v 
	see last commit on each branch

git branch --merged
	see which branches are merged to the the one you're on

git branch --no-merged
	see which branches are not merged to the branch you're on.
