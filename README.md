# lyric search
Lyric search project

# TA recommendation
Given that there are 3 of you and you’re a ragtag group of smart lads, we’d like you to really try to implement the YouTube links functionality (i.e., no longer “potentially”)
How specifically will the user interact with your program?  i.e., command line input and output?  Java Swing gui?  Some other gui
Look into JSoup as a potential solution for scraping.


# Project Plan
Scrape a lyric website to create a database of lyrics. Using a search, users can match a query to generate a list of songs that contain the lyrics. Potentially return Youtube links to those songs.
Use  Java to scrape a lyric website. 
Use Lucene for search algorithms http://lucene.apache.org/core/
